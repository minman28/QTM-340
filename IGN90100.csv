"","review","score"
"1","Human Revolution is a smart, rewarding piece of transhumanist noir that does justice not just to Deus Ex, but to the fiction that inspired it.",0
"2","Shogun 2 is an expertly tuned turn-based strategy game filled with exhilarating real-time tactical battles against a capable artificial intelligence or others online.",0
"3","DICE's adoration of and expertise with the online experience permeates every aspect of its multiplayer. Regardless of the narrative missteps or the occasional glitches, Battlefield 3 offers an unforgettable, world-class multiplayer suite that's sure to excite shooter fans, whether they fired their first bullet in Battlefield 1942 or have just now heeded Battlefield's call of duty.",0
"4","An incredible achievement. Very few games are as original, atmospheric, and consistently brilliant. It belongs in everybody's collection. The journey may be over too quickly, but you will be entertained every minute. This is one of my favorite games.",0
"5","The Witcher 2 is alternately offensive and endearing, grimy and gorgeous, and never ceases to surprise. It's one of the great titles of 2011, and one of the best role-playing games in years.",0
"6","The shocking moments, the gruesome deaths, and the fun of playing through this experience again and again are what I took away from this one.",0
"7","This game is amazing and you owe it to yourself to download it.",0
"8","It's a beautiful, engrossing experience that avoids the anemic, scripted playbook made law by the 500 pound shooter gorilla.",0
"9","In Dirt 3 a few scratches tarnish an otherwise impeccable product. It's a superb racing experience and shouldn't be missed.",0
"10","A great game. It's not only the best launch game for the Nintendo 3DS, but will certainly be regarded as a great purchase for years to come.",0
"11","The subtle tension that builds as strategic plans are hashed out and executed simultaneously on the battlefield is priceless, resulting in a fresh, chaotic experience you'll want to dive into over and over again.",0
"12","Though the character roster should have been larger, and a cheap blue shell can still screw up an otherwise perfect race, MK7 still offers enough innovation to keep this old formula feeling fresh. With memorable new tracks, well implemented gyro controls, the triumphant return of coins and a handful of new modes, Mario Kart 7 is full of win.",0
"13","A stand-out, wonderfully crafted MMO. The story elements deliver on every front, the vocal performances are excellent, and some genuinely clever innovations have been applied to PvP combat. There's also a massive volume of content to keep you hooked for a long time. But it's important to keep in mind that The Old Republic doesn't stray too far from standard MMO mechanics.",0
"14","Saints Row: The Third gives the people what they want and drops us into an open world adult theme park where we can treat ourselves to delightful acts of bloodshed and perversion. It doesn't take itself too seriously and only asks that you don't, either.",0
"15","Considering Super Street Fighter IV was never released on PC, the additions offered in the Arcade Edition are substantial.",0
"16","When a game is this colossal, this rich, it's hard to see how it could possibly be bettered, match engine excepted.",0
"17","Trine 2 throws players into a dazzling fantasy world and gives them three fun tools with which to save it. It's delightfully open-ended, from how you solve problems to whether or not you go it alone. Fans of puzzle games will not be disappointed.",0
"18","There's a steep learning curve, but once you're comfortable with what Rift offers, you will find a deeply immersive experience. Telara is a worthy alternative to Azeroth for anyone looking to explore a new world.",0
"19","A violent and immersive racer that recreates the driving experience like no other game on the market. In doing so it builds well on the first Shift's foundations, benefitting from Slightly Mad Studios' more refined touch and the inclusion of Autolog, but its handling is still too loose and its steps forward too small for it to truly beat Gran Turismo and Forza – although it does enough to ensure that it's pulled ever closer.",0
"20","Sure, I was lured in by Anno 2070's good looks, but its brains and depth that make this one a real beauty. She's a keeper.",0
"21","Orcs Must Die embellishes your devious side, encouraging you to devise clever ways of fulfilling the command of the title. For the not-so-clever, mowing down invaders with an automatic crossbow is also a great time.",0
"22","Though on the surface it looks like just another ""me too"" indie game seeking to ride the coattails of Minecraft's success, Terraria expands on the familiar sandbox gameplay with a greater emphasis on combat and adventure that proves very satisfying.",0
"23","The awesome performances and great facial capture make every interrogation and investigation a riveting affair.",0
"24","A must-own for anyone who loves adventure games, with its stellar writing, gorgeous art, and quotable humor. Throw in the smooth interface, the lack of any normal issues of the genre, and its solid cast, it appeals to gamers of all skills and experience.",0
"25","A brilliant, touching game that is truly special, and that all gamers should make it a point to play.",0
"26","Having done all the writing, animation and programming himself, Gemini Rue took Josh Nuernberger a total of three years to make-the same amount of time it takes some triple-A titles to hit the shelves. If only more triple-A games turned out this well.",0
"27","The combat is more responsive and bloody, you don't need to fight the inventory system anymore, and conversations are more engaging thanks to the adapted Mass Effect wheel. There are downsides though; the semi-linear story and repetitive environments have a negative effect on what is otherwise a great role-playing game.",0
"28","This impressive remake of Star Fox 64 manages to improve upon the original without compromising the magic that made it so memorable to begin with. It's too bad the multiplayer doesn't support online, because otherwise it's the perfect remake of this classic title.",0
"29","It's certainly not a game without its issues, but it's still a great title, and at $10, it's also a total steal.",0
"30","The level of polish found in the graphics and gameplay alike is outstanding for an indie title. Peculiar ideas and inventive mechanics make this quirky bullet-hell shooter a frenzied, fun affair.",0
"31","It's a game about community and sharing and Nadeo does a good job of wrapping up the whole of the Trackmania experience – local multiplayer, online competition, track and car editors and worldwide rankings – into one package.",0
"32","The PC version understandably has some varied controls when using a mouse and keyboard (though it plays just fine with intuitive use of the number keys).",0
"33","It makes warfare into something violently beautiful, and pays homage to the nerdy lore that Warhammer fans like me can't get enough of.",0
"34","Another fine example of what a small development team can accomplish with enough ambition and talent. The game is good-looking, entertaining and boasts a fluidity of play many bigger games would envy.",0
"35","Dungeons of Dredmor's voluminous depths are littered with an abundance of wacky treasure to horde and enticing weaponry to cleaving all sorts of evil beasties in twain with.",0
"36","Despite the lack of genuinely exciting context, all the content packed into Rage is still a blast to play, including the surprisingly entertaining car combat mode and co-operative challenges. Rage isn't revolutionary, but is an expertly crafted, beautiful shooter.",0
"37","Despite its flaws, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 takes the fantastic series we've come to love over the years and iterates on it with great success. The multiplayer is hands-down the best it has ever been, with more features, more modes and a ton of new levels. The singleplayer campaign and Spec Ops mode add value to the overall package, creating something that may not be perfect, but is too damn addicting to pass up.",0
"38","I'm having a blast with Tropico 4, but I know it's not for everyone. Tracking stats, managing an economy and building a million projects at once keeps me engaged, but without a little patience to learn the interface it'll overwhelm many a strategy newcomer.",0
"39","It feels refreshing to be able to say that Sonic is good again. His upward trajectory over the last year continues and he's only gaining momentum. Sonic Generations is largely a game for the most hardcore of Sonic fans, but for the millions who have fond memories of narrowly dodging spikes, grinding on rails, or even that time he was a pinball, Sonic Generations is a game made for you.",0
"40","This edition shows vast improvement.",0
"41","The Sims Medieval has successfully breathed new life into a franchise that was getting pretty stale.",0
"42","Memorable, beautiful and unique, something that stays in your mind long after you've moved on to something else.",0
"43","It features familiar characters and setting but keeps everything fresh with new people, places and pacing.",0
"44","An intriguing action puzzler that is as cute as it is challenging. While the campaign probably won't take you more than five or six hours to get through (and a lot less than that if you know what you're doing), the bonus levels and community levels will keep you entertained as long as you wish.",0
"45","An incredibly strong debut for 3DSWare. Grab this one quickly, 3DS owners, and start recapturing some of that old Mario Golf magic.",0
"46","While the game doesn't do much of note besides bringing the 2008 title to the HD era, it doesn't need to. The story hooks you, dungeon crawling makes for a great time, and exploring your relationships while building a better army is the kind of tinkering you can get lose hours to.",0
"47","It's a shame that Dishonored's story isn't greater than the sum of its decidedly memorable parts, but its gameplay absolutely is.",0
"48","ArenaNet has built one of the most exhaustively detailed and rewarding MMOs in existence, one that never unfairly penalizes and fosters an incredible urge to explore through a generous reward system and achingly pretty environment design.",0
"49","Using player choice, award-winning writing, and your own emotions, The Walking Dead: The Game delivers an experience that's flawed but unforgettable.",0
"50","The one thing worth pointing out between the various platforms is how cool Borderlands 2 can look if you have an awesome PC. The PC version allows plenty of tweaks to draw distance, frame rate and more.",0
"51","With plenty of options, great tutorials and an easy-to-master interface, Colors! 3D is the 3D painting application 3DS owners have been waiting for.",0
"52","Far Cry 3 is important for the same reason as Far Cry 2. It's a shooter that considers shooters thoughtfully, both in the way they're designed and the way we play them, and then asks us to do the same.",0
"53","Rayman Origins takes on a genre mastery of ground work laid down decades ago and elevates it to astronomical new standards. It's a spectacular living painting that's as much fun to play as it is to look at, and it's a total triumph.",0
"54","Torchlight II doesn't do anything radically new, but does everything incredibly well. It fits all the pieces of varied monster behavior, interesting items, excellent skill design and random surprises together into a near-perfect formula, where the action never stops and rewards are never far away.",0
"55","The definitive LittleBigPlanet game...Yes, the jumping is still floaty, the creation complicated and the load times a bit too long, but that doesn't stop LittleBigPlanet PS Vita from being an amazing experience.",0
"56","Like any good expansion – even standalone expansion – it doesn't just add things to the original, it changes them. You'll get an experience much more like a Civil War-era wargame with Fall of the Samurai, as opposed to a medieval wargame with the original Shogun 2, and that, in itself, is worth the cost of admission, let alone all the new units, locations, abilities, factions, and bells/whistles.",0
"57","Football Manager's relentless strive for realism is sometimes its biggest fault, but with new modes and now new ways of playing it's also managed to get that light touch back.",0
"58","If you're a fan of the sport or FIFA in general, it's hard to imagine a game that you'll enjoy more this year.",0
"59","Even with its relatively minor flaws, anyone with even a cursory interest in Tribes: Ascend should play it. No other shooter conveys the same sense of speed – or the rush of pleasure that comes from nailing someone at over 100 KPH – as Tribes.",0
"60","Tales from Space: Mutant Blobs Attack stole my heart. It's visually delicious, the cutscenes ooze with humor, and the actual gameplay feels perfectly balanced.",0
"61","Playing Assassin's Creed III on Wii U's Game Pad is a tad disappointing -- it looks a bit low-res compared to other console ports.",0
"62","It deserves to be played.",0
"63","Not once when you die does Dark Souls help you back up, not once does it let up in its astonishing quality or turn to padding, and not once do the ideas stop coming. Buy it.",0
"64","The few Wii U-exclusive options are hardly worth double-dipping over if you've already bought it for another console, though, and odds are you won't use them much regardless.",0
"65","If this is your first time experiencing Netherrealm's MK reboot or simply didn't get your fill last year, then you'll find a ton of great content here.",0
"66","The scale of PlanetSide 2's battles is often breathtaking, as lines of tanks fire at bases while aircraft light up the sky and hundreds of players fill the scene with healing beams and lethal weapons fire.",0
"67","Connection problems and online funkiness aside, Sound Shapes absolutely floored me. Just about everything it does – and with its grand aesthetic taken as a whole – will blow you away.",0
"68","The visuals are lavishly detailed, with an organic, living beauty that you can choose to view either on your TV or off – the whole game can be played solely on the GamePad if you choose.",0
"69","Nintendo's approach here strikes a great balance in all areas, ranging from its difficulty to design to enemies and bosses.",0
"70","The game is simply addicting, both in its arresting, fast-paced action and its ability to inspire repeat visits with its scalable difficulty, bite-sized mentality and seemingly endless amount of unlockable content.",0
"71","Load times could be a bit shorter and I wouldn't mind seeing the price come down, but Lumines: Electronic Symphony is amazing. It's the simple puzzle game we've known for a while coupled with new mechanics like the shuffle block and the Vita's connectivity.",0
"72","It never loses sight of the singular imperative to kill as many orcs as possible, and while there's a sense that too much has been recycled from the first outing, its unique combination of tower defense and action mechanics reach near perfection here. A qualified triumph for veterans of the first game and newcomers alike.",0
"73","Though the camera can cause issues and the supernatural story that's more interested in asking questions than answering them, it's a tough game to put down once you've started. Remedy's done a great job of mixing elements of written work, television, and videogames to create an experience full of scares, laughs, and thrills that's just as fun to play as it is to watch.",0
"74","Sword & Sworcery masterfully blends music, art, storytelling and gameplay in deeply poetic ways that you just don't see very often. As such, it doesn't take a love of adventure games to get wrapped up in the magic of this indie gem.",0
"75","Wading through BlazBlue: Continuum Shift Extend's massive vocabulary and doubly complex battle systems will demand time and patience from any gamer. But the cast powering this engrossing fighter makes all the effort worthwhile, and the huge variety of modes dresses up play in different ways.",0
"76","A great handheld game, one that not only pushes the boundaries and standards of the Nintendo 3DS but one that recaptures a long-forgotten spirit of a classic franchise. Make no mistake about it, this is a full Resident Evil adventure that isn't watered down because it's in portable form.",0
"77","Offers a gorgeous visual presentation, an intriguing story and incredible puzzle design - all in one of the most charming gaming worlds out there.",0
"78","Everything about this well-crafted romp through deadly dungeons comes together to pull you into its mysterious realm and hold on.",0
"79","If for some reason you absolutely cannot stand its sense of humor, you may want to think twice, because it's as prevalent and over-the-top as ever here. Otherwise, Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage represents Borderlands 2 at its distilled, unapologetic best.",0
"80","The best questing in World of Warcraft, with strong emphasis on storytelling, resulting in an entertaining run from 85 to 90 that seldom tumbles into tedium.",0
"81","It has a believable cast of characters and a great look. Sure, the puzzles some adventure gamers love are missing and there will be an audio hiccup here and there, but as an introductory hook to the five-episode series, The Walking Dead Episode 1 has just about everything fans could want.",0
"82","Titles like Botanicula are why the point-and-click adventure genre continues to exist. It may not be as hilarious as adventure games of yesteryear, but it's persistently delightful, oozing character and grabbing hold of the imagination.",0
"83","Embrace it on its own terms, and you'll find a game that comes the closest a survival horror game has come to replicating the experience of the first Silent Hill game in recent years; indeed, in some ways, it's even better.",0
"84","Level for level, gun for gun, the campaign, multiplayer and zombies content of Black Ops 2 on Wii U is almost the same. This version may cut the livestreaming feature, and currently doesn't have Elite, but it makes up for it with some nifty GamePad functionality.",0
"85","No matter what you're looking for, whether it be amazing gameplay, immersive storytelling or perhaps a riveting new world to explore as you fully customize and re-customize your character at will, Reckoning has it all.",0
"86","Packed with content, and it's a joy to play. Whether you're returning to Snake's adventures or experiencing them for the first time, these two games feel at home on the Vita, look great and will keep you busy for quite some time.",0
"87","Gods and Kings enhances the base game immensely, so much so that I can't imagine playing Civilization V without it.",0
"88","So Mighty Switch Force: Hyper Drive Edition doesn't go as far as it could have gone in remastering the 3DS original, but the changes that are present here are superb – veterans will love the challenge of the new Hyper levels, and the quality of the high-definition art is so good that it'd be worthwhile to buy the game on looks alone.",0
"89","The result is a game that is neither simulation nor arcade but a subtle blend of the two, with a control system about as deep as an arcade fighter.",0
"90","The game is great and an impressive launch title for the PlayStation Vita. It's just that the Uncharted series has been known for being a story-driven experience, and Golden Abyss goes in another direction. It's a beautiful, fun game with tons of collectibles, plenty of laughs, and some cool twists on a franchise PlayStation fans know so well. It's just not an instant classic like the other entries in the series.",0
"91","The PC version has the technical edge on console versions and is therefore a slightly improved experience, but other than that it's got all the same triumphs and flaws: it isn't as huge an improvement upon its predecessors' achievements as many players will be hoping for, but it's still up there with the best that the series has achieved. Even if it isn't quite the best.",0
"92","Mutant Mudds is a fitting homage to the 8-bit era of gaming. It's got lots of personality, and though its gameplay may be a bit too simplified, the clever, challenging levels still provide plenty of good times.",0
"93","Newcomers will find F1 2012 a shock to the system compared to more conventional racing games, but the ample tools provided to get into the sport provide a gratifying experience with just a little bit of commitment on the player's part.",0
"94","Above everything, Absolution is a game that wants you to experiment with it. It refuses to be rushed through, rewarding brains over brawn.",0
"95","It's the racing game for people who don't tend to like racing games. You're not punished for missing that apex or abandoning that nagging racing line.",0
"96","A great game - one worthy of your attention, particularly if you've never played it.",0
"97","It's by no means perfect – the inclusion of proper online multiplayer would've added another point – but you'd be hard-pushed to find a game as good as this for the price. If Motorstorm RC is an indication of the kind of quality gaming Vita will offer at such an attractive price then maybe Vita does have what it takes to stay the distance.",0
"98","Although the RPG elements feel a bit wasted, the varied gameplay options, scaled difficulty settings, and plethora of unlockable goodies still make for an excellent rhythm experience.",0
"99","Amid a sea of sloppy ports, the Wii U version Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed shines like a veritable beacon: with the possible exception of Tekken Tag Tournament 2 it's the best multiplatform title on the console, and might just have the edge over the PS3 and 360 versions of the game, not least because offline play is now available for five players instead of four.",0
"100","The nature of the system makes for more forgiving ventures into the depths of the game's item worlds and the pixel art may be easier to forgive on the smaller screen. Platform aside, this was already an excellent turn-based strategy game that, although too heavy on frivolous exposition, can be explored and enjoyed from here to eternity.",0
"101","It is impossible not to be drawn in by the simple perfection of New Super Mario Bros 2's mechanics and level design – this is as pleasurable and effortless as 2D platforming gets. But it's also impossible not to be disappointed that it's over so quickly, and doesn't offer anything really new.",0
"102","A brilliant show of what Nintendo's new console and tablet controller are capable of, and has far more depth and content then you'd expect from a mini-game collection.",0
"103","I'm nearly 80 puzzles into Dokuro, and I'm still having a blast. In fact, it's been hard to put down.",0
"104","With its fast-paced action, compelling use of the 3D effect, nearly 100 different levels to conquer and compelling multiplayer mode, this puzzle game is an absolutely stunning addition to the 3DS eShop.",0
"105","Despite some dips in overall puzzle difficulty this time around, the game has a massive amount of content to both discover and create from scratch.",0
"106","An enjoyable experience with an engaging story and incredible characterization. Although the platforming is far from fluid and the story can feel convoluted at times, when KH3D soars, it soars high - capturing that KH magic that has propelled the series to great success for a decade now.",0
"107","Great shooting mechanics and deep customization options make for an addictive combination, and its free-to-play model makes it easy to jump into with no upfront cost.",0
"108","Its skillful blend of witty writing, fun shooting, and tactical tower defense makes for hours of replayable gameplay. Take into account the loot grind that Iron Brigade inspires, and the online co-op, and Double Fine's created a title I hope turns into a franchise.",0
"109","Its tools are flexible enough to allow you to create a huge variety of monsters and levels, and it’s easy to get addicted to its sometimes-frustrating-but-always-gratifying levels. Few games have the creative flair – both in visuals and design – of Incredipede.",0
"110","Sakura Samurai: Art of the Sword is a gorgeous game, and a brilliant addition to the 3DS library. The art style and music transport you to another world, and the combat is more than engaging.",0
"111","Despite some dips in overall puzzle difficulty this time around, the game has a massive amount of content to both discover and create from scratch.",0
"112","It's a fantastic set of options, even if the modes themselves aren't too out of the ordinary, with classic, deathmatch and fort to choose from.",0
"113","Smart As is great at what it does. It's a fun brain teaser for you to pop in whenever you get a second or whenever you feel like a quick challenge.",0
"114","It's a more responsive, faster action title that does away with the damning side of its dazzling animation. This is a smooth brawler with gorgeous spectacle, and its dedication to nailing its second chance makes it one of the best action games in recent memory.",0
"115","Nano Assault Neo is their boldest, more beautiful shooter yet, and Wii U owners absolutely shouldn't miss out on its shiny twin-stick shooting.",0
"116","WayForward has struck gold once again, as the studio continues to prove its skill at crafting superb game designs for Nintendo platforms.",0
"117","I haven’t been so challenged by a Zelda since Ocarina of Time, and rarely have I been so consistently surprised by one.",0
"118","This is a superb 2D platformer that’s as easy to hate as it is to love, and your patience for punishment will be the determining factor. Players who live to overcome abusive challenges and obsess over discovering new things will hunger for Spelunky's deeply rewarding exploration.",0
"119","But once you start to learn its secrets, there’s a wild and exciting variety of play here that’s unmatched, even by its peers. It’s a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush.",0
"120","Whether you’re a fretboard virgin or a would be virtuoso, Rocksmith 2014 deserves a place in your daily practice routine.",0
"121","What FIFA 14 on next-gen consoles does right now is add an impressive visual layer to an already brilliant sports game.",0
"122","Building on five generations of games, a digital menagerie of captivating creatures, and a wide range of diverse regions to explore, Pokemon X and Y proves this formulaic portable role-playing series can still deliver an innovative experience.",0
"123","All its different plotlines and personalities overlap and combine to create something that’s intriguingly opaque, but always entertaining, and genuinely funny. Whatever it is, it’s worth playing.",0
"124","It’s every bit as amazing on the PC as it is on its native PlayStation 3.",0
"125","Game Freak has really outdone itself this time, and Pokemon X and Y will be remembered as great transition point for the series’ transformation into an even more social, beautiful, and strategic game.",0
"126","Very few puzzle games have ever managed to marry impeccable challenges with a mature storytelling quite like this – there's no fluff or extraneous content here, only a prime example of how to create a tight, unforgettable gaming experience.",0
"127","It sincerely believes that imagination really is the most important faculty, and in turn, succeeded in transporting me back to a time when I built strange worlds equipped with nothing but crayons and card.",0
"128","FIFA 14 isn’t a leap into the future of the series; it has a lot in common with the version of FIFA 14 that's already out. There are real flashes of potential, though, and hints at where it may go in the future.",0
"129","Easy to recommend to anyone interested in historical strategy – it’s the best game in the series, which can now take its place, with no caveats, among the giants of the genre.",0
"130","A delight. There’s nothing else like its gentle combination of exploration, strategy and discovery, and it made me feel both empathy and responsibility for virtual creatures that most games would treat as disposable fodder.",0
"131","This edition is not only a smooth-flowing piece of pro basketball simulation, it’s also one of the few games that makes a true next-generation leap in visual fidelity.",0
"132","While these new additions may have imbalanced Most Wanted U in some respects, they’ve also created a sandbox of greater possibilities and accessibility.",0
"133","Kerrigan's vengeful rampage may come with a generous helping of cheese and some tedious boss fights, but the chance to play with increasingly powerful units and abilities makes up for a lot – as does some inventive mission design and greater-than-average replayabilty appeal.",0
"134","An amazing expansion to a brilliant tactical game.",0
"135","Shows Nintendo at its inventive best. It’s an essential game in the 3DS’ increasingly impressive line-up, and though I sometimes wished that it would leave me alone to explore more at my own pace, it’s otherwise difficult to fault a game this detailed, absorbing and masterfully made.",0
"136","Path of Exile successfully captures the spirit of older action RPGs and updates it for an experience that's as visually appealing as it's fun.",0
"137","Its PS4 launch problems aren't easily forgiven, what with the unreliable stability DICE is striving to fix, but because the core game is so strong, Battlefield 4 is worth either sticking with or waiting for.",0
"138","This edition is not only a smooth-flowing piece of pro basketball simulation, it’s also one of the few games that makes a true next-generation leap in visual fidelity.",0
"139","Long-time Devil May Cry fans unsure of Ninja Theory's treatment can abandon their fears. DmC hurls Dante into a newer, better world, complete with a glorious combat system and enough style to make old Dante proud...This is digital action at its finest.",0
"140","Telltale has once again delivered a well-written adventure, this time with an added dose of stylish noir presentation.",0
"141","One of my favourite games of 2013 so far. It’s a hugely compelling mix of 2D action-platforming and Roguelike game design, with excellent pixel art and just the right level of challenge. It’s the wildly inventive traits system, however – and the fact that it’s meaningful – that really elevates Rogue Legacy.",0
"142","This is the most fun I’ve had with Civilization since Civ IV, and the best late-game since Civ II. Brave New World is the rare case of a title delivering exactly what it promises.",0
"143","Taking Terraria with you on-the-go puts an exciting spin on the absorbing formula, and the Vita version thankfully doesn't skimp on the goods. There's no depth sacrificed here.",0
"144","A fantastic idea, beautifully executed.",0
"145","There are more laughs in this DLC that many entire comedy games, made stronger by being undercut with a real poignancy.",0
"146","Etrian IV matches its hardcore depth to appealing visuals and more inviting design, and in doing so allows the series to transcend niche status. Atlus has crafted a fantastic portable RPG, and the perfect entry point for Etrian newcomers.",0
"147","A tense, challenging, and excellent shooter. It may be short, but its addictive cycle of cylindrical shooter gameplay, great looks, and catchy music make it worth replaying in endless pursuit of that high score on the leaderboard.",0
"148","It’s more than 70 levels of superb tower defense that you can play wherever and whenever you want. Sure, I wish co-op carried over to single-player, that the difficulty spikes weren’t so maddening, and that there was a new island of levels, but that doesn’t take away from how excellent PixelJunk Monsters: Ultimate HD is.",0
"149","Gunpoint is a refreshingly welcome addition to the burgeoning stealth genre. It nails player movement, puzzles, and storytelling in games, and completely removes anything that stands in the way of these three.",0
"150","A great port of an amazing game. The extra world is a worthwhile addition, and the new easy mode should allow even more people to enjoy the ride.",0
"151","Shin Megami Tensei IV succeeds on the merits of its outstanding demon fusion system and combat, even if its story and exploration are only fair.",0
"152","Beyond the underwhelming main campaign, Black Flag delivers a world brimming with gorgeous places to go, amazing secrets to discover, and nefarious pirates to stab.",0
"153","Grounded in tradition and learning from the lessons of the games that preceded it, it thrives on the strength of its excitingly varied and flexible class system and highly mobile combat.",0
"154","With a great atmosphere and deceptively simple mechanics, it stands out as one of the most unique and addicting games of 2013.",0
"155","Act II of Kentucky Route Zero provides another sharp walkabout into a beautifully surreal world. Though it poses more questions than it answers, it still left me pining for the next chapter. If the final three acts manage to be as powerful and evocative as the first two, Kentucky Route Zero is going to be looked back on as a tremendous and singular accomplishment in gaming.",0
"156","Splinter Cell is back on the right shadowy track.",0
"157","These tables have never looked better than they do on PS4, and the gameplay is authentic right down to the sound and pressure of each tables’ flippers.",0
"158","The monsters are stunning, the fights can be incomparably exhilarating, and the 3DS and Wii U connectivity is really impressive – even if the online infrastructure is still rather archaic.",0
"159","Antichamber has some of the more clever puzzles of any game I've played. It doesn't have much in the way of personality, and its bizarre ending left me wondering why it was included at all, but it makes the act of exploration utterly thrilling.",0
"160","The stellar game design is emboldened by the three different characters you can play as. From start to finish, Gunman Clive is a fantastic platformer, good enough that it is worth playing multiple times to play as every character.",0
"161","Battlefield 4 is an excellent multiplayer game that makes the most of its ambitions, proving once again that destruction is a valuable strategic addition to competitive combat, which reaches its full potential with two killer Commanders are bringing out the best in their squads. On the other hand, its single-player campaign is a disappointing.",0
"162","If you've never experienced this survival horror indie sidescroller before, this is the best way to jump in. The hero's journey seems particularly personal on the Vita in dark rooms, and the Vita's control scheme suits the retro experience implied by the visuals.",0
"163","The Grimoire Stone system is too random to be consistently useful, and might make you miss out on a good chunk of Millennium Girl’s content. But what’s here is still some of the most difficult and rewarding turn-based battling you can find on the 3DS.",0
"164","Proteus is a very different sort of interactive experience. Maybe, by your definition, it's not even a game. But that doesn't matter. It's a joyous experiment in exploration from start to finish – even if it is a very, very short-lived one.",0
"165","Much like Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, this is a textbook example of a fighting game port done properly. Dead or Alive 5 Plus is the genuine article, matching and occasionally surpassing its excellent console brethren in nearly every regard.",0
"166","It may be lighter on girth than where we left off last generation, and still lacking much-requested features like night racing and rain, but wrestling a car through some of the world’s most legendary corners at the very limits of adhesion has never looked or felt this good on console.",0
"167","On 3DS, even without the Circle Pad Pro attachment, controlling the camera using the touchscreen works surprisingly well. It’s not quite perfect, but it’s certainly a lot better than it ever was on the PSP; it’s only noticeably slow when you’re fighting underwater.",0
"168","When comparing the PS4 and Xbox One versions side-by-side, there’s little to no variation in textures and effects, but there is a discernible difference in resolution. While both are displayed at 1080p, the Xbox One version upscales the game from 720p resolution. In contrast, the PS4 version runs natively at 1080p, which makes character models, weapons, and environments look noticeably sharper and more detailed. The difference is especially apparent on larger-sized TVs, where pixel density weighs more heavily in picture quality.",0
"169","Call of Duty: Ghosts isn't a reinvention of the franchise, but proves there's still room for innovation within its existing formula.",0
"170","Sanctum 2 improves on the first Sanctum in almost every way, including its robust leveling system and perks, its improved turret management, its visual style, and its customization.",0
"171","Peggle 2 is one-button joy. You think, you aim, you fire, and you sit back and watch as massive combos and bright popping colors take over. That it’s such a joyful sequel to an all-time classic stretches my grin from ear to ear, just like most of the rest of Peggle 2.",0
"172","Naturally the PC version (our test machine was packing two AMD Radeon HD 7970 graphics cards) was the visually superior of the three, thanks to its higher definition, better lighting and textures and all manner of other fog effects and shading employed on the highest graphics settings.",0
"173","As with previous Total War games, the consequence of all those detailed and interrelated systems is a sometimes-obstructive interface and erratic AI. If you grow to love Rome II – and there is a lot to love about this game – you'll love it in spite of its persistent flaws and frustrations.",0
"174","At roughly three hours, it presents a fully realized, well-paced story arc with multiple peaks and valleys that does what many episodic games fail to do – wrap things up while leaving the door open for subsequent chapters.",0
"175","This is an old-school shooter that actually gets what made old-school shooters work, and it gives us some clever new ideas on top of them.",0
"176","From start to finish, the experience is so enjoyable that it's easily recommendable to any 3DS owner with an affinity for rhythm games. If only Game Freak would step out of their Pokémon shell more often, because the result of the developer's experimentation is awesome.",0
"177","Even after completing Unmasked’s 12 levels, which took around 10 hours, I feel like I’ve only scratched the surface of the creative ways to unravel its enigmas - which makes me want to keep playing it even more.",0
"178","Though at the risk of overcomplicating things at times, its robust multiplayer gameplay, surprisingly fun co-op modes, and lengthy, challenging, and varied campaign makes Ghosts one of the best Call of Duty games to date.",0
"179","The real star is still the ability to play on the couch with up to three friends, tearing through the angry hordes that await you in adventure mode, where the wildly randomized dungeons form the backbone of Diablo 3's endgame.",0
"180","It ain’t pretty, it ain’t noisy, it will absolutely piss you off, but that only makes those successes all the sweeter.",0
"181","It’s a surprisingly huge, dense world, and I soon realized there were still entire sandboxes I hadn’t even set foot in. Even in my hundredth hour, I’m still discovering.",0
"182","The best kart racing game Nintendo has made in a long time. It strikes a careful balance between refining old ideas while introducing fresh new ones. Admittedly, its gorgeous graphics and jazzy orchestrated soundtrack bolster its presentation, but you’re getting a lot more than just looks with this one.",0
"183","Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition isn't a vapid rebranding or a blatant cash-in, but a welcome infusion of the original game with new areas, monsters, and bundled-in DLC.",0
"184","The elegant simplicity of Hearthstone’s rules, its impressive attention to detail and personality, and the true viability of playing completely for free make it easy to fall under its spell and get blissfully lost in the depths of its strategic possibilities.",0
"185","Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition isn't a vapid rebranding or a blatant cash-in, but a welcome infusion of the original game with new areas, monsters, and bundled-in DLC.",0
"186","After a day with Shadow of Mordor on Xbox One, I can confidently recommend it just as strongly as the PS4 and PC versions. True, this is probably the worst-looking of the bunch by a small margin.",0
"187","A fun and approachable battle royale that makes excellent use of its deceptively simple retro looks and classic arcade platforming style.",0
"188","Every second is a mad scramble for ammo, powerups, and survival that, while sadly limited to local play only, kept my group of four players glued to their controllers with its highly competitive action.",0
"189","With Reaper of Souls, and the recent round of content patches, Blizzard has transformed Diablo 3 into something far more akin to what long-time fans like me wanted all along.",0
"190","Divinity: Original Sin is one of the most rewarding RPGs to come along in years.",0
"191","An emphasis on fun pervades every detail of the experience, whether it's in the prevalent rare enemies dotting the countryside, the chance of upgradable loot, or bonus areas that encourage exploration.",0
"192","Not only is it an outstanding Vita and PS4 game, but it’s the first game in a long time to give me the thrilling sense of mastery that a well-played level of Sonic the Hedgehog used to back in the 90s.",0
"193","Though Titanfall is somewhat regrettably a barebones game in terms of modes and customization features available at launch, its intense action is almost as exciting to watch a friend play as it is to pick up the controller yourself.",0
"194","The time I’ve spent with Binding of Isaac: Rebirth has been non-stop fun and surprises, with just a tad too much frustration when I lose a rare item.",0
"195","It’s surprisingly lacking many accoutrements we’ve come to expect in a multiplayer shooter, but it nevertheless unites its elements in a cohesive, approachable way. Titanfall earns a seat at the table with the genre’s entrenched powerhouses.",0
"196","Now, with the Ultimate Evil Edition on PS4 and Xbox One, Diablo 3 takes on its highest form, melding the successes of two years of patching with the positive side-effects of porting to current-gen consoles.",0
"197","The upstep in visual detail from the older console versions is a nice bonus, but Tomb Raider didn’t need massaging. It’s the same well-realised action reboot for Lara Croft that came as such a pleasant surprise last year.",0
"198","The location is right, the car list extensive, the handling nuanced but accessible, and the visuals are excellent. Above everything it’s always fun.",0
"199","Resogun's core remains intact and as fun as ever. Heroes simply acts as a reason to come back for more.",0
"200","The Legend of Grimrock 2 is an RPG that's as much Myst as D&D, and benefits from the strengths of both.",0
"201","Not only one of the most expansive RPGs I’ve ever played, but one of the few that successfully fills its gorgeous, massive world with meaningful things to do and see. A frustratingly vague plot and typical BioWare bugginess drag it down a bit, but both in combat and out, Inquisition marks a welcome return to the RPG depth that made Dragon Age: Origins and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic so magnetic.",0
"202","Fans and open-minded newcomers will enjoy a substantial adventure that proves the JRPG is alive and kicking.",0
"203","It is, in a way, Season 18 all by itself. It is funny, shocking, self-effacing, and pretty much everything I could ask for from a South Park game -- even if it’s mostly a one-and-done experience.",0
"204","Despite its less than compelling plot, I still want to go back to explore and fight through every nook and cranny of Dragon Age: Inquisition, until every dragon’s skull is mounted on my wall.",0
"205","Smash 3DS is impressive and, for the most part, feels right at home on 3DS. The multitude of ways to play and awesome customization gave me many reasons to keep fighting - and I’ve been at it for more than 45 hours already.",0
"206","Shovel Knight is my favorite game of 2014 so far, and a true testament to the power of the old-school. Whether you were weaned on an NES like I was, or don't yet know what you missed in a time before you were born, Shovel Knight is an absolute must-play.",0
"207","Valkyria Chronicles is gorgeous, engrossing, and not for the impatient. In other words, it's a great fit for PC gamers, who'll hopefully give the underappreciated Valkyria a wider audience than it found on PS3.",0
"208","This collection delivers more than a huge Halo fan like myself could have reasonably imagined and, even with its (hopefully temporary) online issues, it packs an insane amount of first-person shooter greatness onto one disc.",0
"209","Diversity is one of Far Cry 4’s strongest assets, and it overwhelms the mostly disappointing story with countless opportunities for free-form adventure and fun.",0
"210","It’s still well-written, sympathetic, exciting, beautiful, and just incredibly well-made.",0
"211","Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor stands out from other open-world action games by putting a great new layer on top of the trail that Batman blazed. I was surprised at how well it integrates its excellent combat with rewarding feedback and progression not just for me, but also for my enemies.",0
"212","Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor stands out from other open-world action games by putting a great new layer on top of the trail that Batman blazed. I was surprised at how well it integrates its excellent combat with rewarding feedback and progression not just for me, but also for my enemies. I",0
"213","Guilty Gear Xrd has enough wacky characters and well-crafted tutorials to be interesting for novices, but it’s those of us seeking a challenge that will find the most to love here.",0
"214","Any of Tales from the Borderlands Episode 1: Zer0 Sum’s minor setbacks feel like nothing when put up against the strength of the characters, the caliber of the writing, and the charm of the world.",0
"215","Despite their seemingly miserable setting, both Metro games are in fact fun, diverse shooter-adventures, and the remastered 2033 does a good job of smoothing down the original's rougher edges at the expense of some of its brutal personality.",0
"216","Prime’s simultaneous turn structure makes for a tense experience that’s both intelligent and rewarding.",0
"217","Getting both [titles] in a single, enhanced package is a great way to discover (or rediscover) the Moscow Metro's unconventional charms.",0
"218","A beautiful remake that irons out nearly all of the problems and limitations of 1997’s Abe's Oddysee while bringing its best qualities to the fore.",0
"219","The Wolf Among Us Episode 5: Cry Wolf is a wonderful cap to Telltale’s season. It made me not only want to replay the episode to see various outcomes, but the entire series to see if I had missed any clues planted early on.",0
"220","Each map is polished, every God looks and sounds great, and exceptional Match of the Day modes offer plenty of variety. Some late-game balance issues aside, Smite’s divine execution of innovative ideas make it a worthy contender.",0
"221","Though there were points when its puzzles completely stumped me, and the combat’s steep difficulty, made me want to launch my 3DS into orbit a few times, the enjoyable battle system, deep exploration, and generous dollops of fanservice made it worth the effort.",0
"222","The PlayStation 4 and PC versions are nearly identical save for one feature: On PS4, you can choose to have the sword’s voice come out of the speaker on the controller. While it seems gimmicky on paper, I found myself playing through the entire game this way, and really appreciating the immersion it added to my experience.",0
"223","Getting both [games] in a single, enhanced package is a great way to discover (or rediscover) the Moscow Metro's unconventional charms.",0
"224","Whether or not you have ever enjoyed Metal Gear, this is a must for anyone who appreciates melee-combat. It’s simple, fast, and clean, with enough supporting content like additional weapons and secrets to encourage a campaign replay – or more, if you find yourself obsessed with the idea of a no-kill run.",0
"225","Transistor is a wildly smart action-RPG that places all of its trust into your intelligence. Nothing from its cyberpunk story rife with mysteries, to its deep combat that encourages experimentation, is ever spelled out for you, which I personally loved.",0
"226","This is a Call of Duty game to its core, but one that rehashes as little as possible while still retaining its strengths.",0
"227","Don't expect great depth or long-term thrills, but the action while it lasts is a master of both second-by-second action, and the structures that effortlessly stretch it out into a good few hours without it overstaying its welcome.",0
"228","Beneath Broforce’s hyperbolic chest-thumping action movie-inspired silliness lies an extremely polished run ’n gun platformer. Simple and reliable but nuanced and ever-changing (thanks to the constantly rotating characters) Broforce is testosterrific.",0
"229","Being able to play something that celebrates over two decades of excellent music brought me lots of joy, and serves as a reminder that Final Fantasy has some of the best music in video game history.",0
"230","Tropical Freeze is a great platformer full of tense sequences and tough levels. Boss battles are a huge highlight, and it’s packed with hard-to-find secrets and collectibles.",0
"231","The artwork on display is stunning, and the combat is constantly engaging, and the characters openly defy genre convention. But perhaps the best thing I can say about Child of Light is that I was often unsure as to whether I was headed in the direction I was supposed to, and I never once cared. I just wanted to fly to every corner of the world, take it in, and smile.",0
"232","Thanks to its clever puzzle design and brilliant progression, Stealth Inc. 2: A Game of Clones sets itself apart from its more obvious inspirations.",0
"233","It embraces its PS2-era roots while offering almost everything you could want from a modern football simulation.",0
"234","Though it’s an unmistakable tribute to Metroid and Castlevania, infusing a sharp wit and bold style helps Shantae and the Pirate’s Curse stand above its retro-inspired contemporaries.",0
"235","Sportsfriends is one of the most dynamic and addictingly deep local multiplayer games I’ve ever played.",0
"236","A Crooked Mile represents a new high point in Telltale's take on Fables. It's a smart, brutal, and emotional episode that pushes the story forward and fleshes out nearly every player on the board.",0
"237","None of it feels focus-tested, or designed to appeal to the broadest possible audience; rather, it always comes off as exactly the expression its creators intended.",0
"238","An amazing achievement. Its story is powerful, its freedom is liberating, and its world is one of the most beautiful I’ve ever wandered around. Here’s to more games not holding your hand.",0
"239","It’s a little safe, overall -- its competitive multiplayer stands out as a gamble that paid off -- in that it has many familiar elements from Far Cry 3 transplanted to an amazing new place, but those elements are incredibly empowering and rewarding.",0
"240","I’ve always felt PES was at its best as a couch-based multiplayer game, but it’s heartening to see such a robust online component.",0
"241","While launch bugs and a few lackluster mechanics mildly restrain WildStar, they’re isolated pockets in a colorful sea of creativity and personality. WildStar is loud, bright, and raucous, and if that style doesn’t click with you than WildStar probably won’t either, but it’s also a deep and open experience that will undoubtedly return as much as you care to put into it.",0
"242","It’s the most exhilarating competitive game I’ve played in years.",0
"243","The increased emphasis on defensive play, a great new play-calling system, and the return of long-time favorites makes this year’s Madden one of the best in recent memory, even if it could still use work in regards to its stale commentary and longstanding bugs.",0
"244","In Harm’s Way deepened my empathy for characters I’m legitimately worried will die, or worse.",0
"245","The way Sledgehammer has integrated its enhanced abilities and choices into every aspect of how we fight went above and beyond.",0
"246","It doesn't take many risks with the established formula, but its story is engaging, intelligently written and compelling to the end.",0
"247","Big, gorgeous, and a hell of a lot of fun. Never has getting from point A to point B in an open-world game provided so much enjoyment. It provides some of the most fun, frantic, and fantastic gaming I've had on the Xbox One.",0
"248","Galactic Civilizations 3 doesn't do much to change the established explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate grand strategy model aside from its ideological advancement tree, but its extensive customization, faction personality, and overall quality make it an excellent game.",0
"249","The Banner Saga deserves commendation for the strength of its art and music experience alone, which shatters conventions. That experience, in turn, complements a bleak story of a world teetering before its fall, where the harshness of the Scandinavian landscape mirrors the plight of mutually distrustful refugees.",0
"250","Its quirky humor – made all the better by excellent writing and interesting characters – is constantly unsettled by the seriousness of the plot, making for a unique adventure that Vita gamers owe it to themselves to experience.",0
"251","With only a brief introduction to Rhys and Fiona, they have already become a pair of my favorite Telltale characters, and the fantastic final scene of the Zer0 Sum has be anxiously awaiting my return trip to Pandora.",0
"252","It plays great, and it looks even better, but its advancements also beg it to be held to a higher standard, one that its overall story and morality systems struggle to reach.",0
"253","This year’s game is both exciting and reassuring that EA Sports isn’t wasting opportunities to improve the series.",0
"254","Everything that makes the Football Manager series so damned addictive remains completely intact and has been expanded upon in FM2015, but intelligent changes made to navigation and the way data is displayed makes for a much friendlier experience and speeds up seasons considerably.",0
"255","Feels very much like a send-off for the Rapture and Columbia eras of BioShock – a carefully crafted, appropriately mind-bending sendoff.",0
"256","Superb gameplay, a breakneck pace and terrifying enemies makes The Evil Within a wonderful survival horror experience.",0
"257","If it’s impossible to dismiss the allure of authentic chants, stadia, team names, and kits, it’s telling that PES 2015 is intrinsically rewarding enough not to require those hooks. Strip away the fripperies and there’s a clear winner – and this year, for once, it isn’t EA Sports.",0
"258","By designing the levels in the campaign, co-op, and multiplayer to facilitate those new mechanics, Advanced Warfare is granted a weight and importance that changes how the fast-paced shooting action feels in all three modes.",0
"259","You don’t have to be a hardcore golf fan to get hooked on Mario Golf: World Tour. It rewards good play, gives plenty to do, and is a great teacher. Its incremental approach to challenge kept me coming back to test myself, and the post-game challenges and multiplayer modes inspired me to play in new ways even after I thought I was a pro.",0
"260","Every aspect of Child of Light has an unmistakably artisinal, organic feel to it.",0
"261","Fantasia: Music Evolved provides a surprising amount of control and personalization options over each song, which is paired with fun gameplay to bring a fresh new style to the music game genre.",0
"262","Smoke and Mirrors is a great second act to The Wolf Among Us. Its 90 minutes are packed with memorable characters and scenes, as well as some of the most agonizing decisions Telltale has ever forced me to make.",0
"263","Hohokum is one of those games that could only have been created by a small team, so distinct are the voices within the presentation and design.",0
"264","A brutal, challenging, and remarkably fun game. Its eerie world and imaginative enemies are genuinely frightening, and the scares are heightened significantly by the scarcity of resources at your disposal.",0
"265","Playing the Definitive Edition reminded me how much I enjoyed its excellent story and characters, combat, and city, but also made me pine for a true new-gen sequel.",0
"266","A Bird Story uses nuanced visual language to tell a wonderful, heartfelt story about friendship and loneliness.",0
"267","Even if the plot isn’t terribly interesting, the many characters who play a part in it are, and along with the excellent combat and RPG gameplay, they elevate The Witcher 3 to a plane few other RPGs inhabit.",0
"268","If you missed it on PS3, do yourself a favor and experience it on PS4. If you did play on PS3, you now own it on PS4, so this minimal graphical update is an excellent excuse to revisit it.",0
"269","There’s an incredible power to unlocking its mysteries, and in succeeding, despite its demand for a pound of your flesh.",0
"270","Even if the plot isn’t terribly interesting, the many characters who play a part in it are, and along with the excellent combat and RPG gameplay, they elevate The Witcher 3 to a plane few other RPGs inhabit.",0
"271","Massive in size, and meticulously detailed, The Witcher 3 ends Geralt's story on a high note.",0
"272","The Witcher 3: Hearts of Stone wraps an interesting story and great gameplay additions into one well-rounded expansion.",0
"273","Despite some cumbersome menus and a single drag of a dungeon, Majora’s Mask is a great adventure that (repeatedly) stands the test of time.",0
"274","It honors the classics, brings great ideas of its own, and in the process it emerges as a classic itself. Games like this are always about the journey, and it's sure as hell a journey worth taking.",0
"275","The crown jewel is King's Fall, a demanding high-level activity that, despite the strict six-person requirement, will keep me playing into the late hours of the night.",0
"276","Its action is brutal, over-the-top, and rewarding; a hyperactive arcade-style shoot-em-up with enough dynamism to keep me captivated moment to moment, but a strong sense of strategy to give me something to invest in over longer playthroughs.",0
"277","There will always be more levels to play thanks to the online creation community, and a virtually endless pool of challenges to overcome.",0
"278","You can find RPGs that are prettier, more accessible, or less busy, but very few are as dedicated to the true spirit of role-playing as this one is.",0
"279","Kerbal Space Program does the improbable: it makes learning a complex subject fun. Its cute, clueless characters and sense of humor turn a hardcore physics simulator into something replayable and addictive.",0
"280","If you want the RPG with the most skills, the most stats to consider, and a world that constantly makes meaningful use of every line on your character sheet, there’s nothing else quite like Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition.",0
"281","It's often frustrating and sometimes confusing, but its spectacular platforming, memorable world, and engrossing story wash those concerns away.",0
"282","Legacy of the Void offers tons of StarCraft 2 fun for both casual and hardcore RTS players.",0
"283","The logic used to dispatch enemies should ideally play out like a neat algorithm, flawlessly executed once you know their patterns and how to manipulate them. That’s not how it works, of course, as the dungeons are complicated, chaotic things, and players are forced to move at the whim of the soundtrack’s tempo, with little room for error. Logic meets chaos. It’s a tension evident in many games, and it’s exemplified wonderfully here.",0
"284","The addition of tank combat thematically clashes with everything Batman stands for, but it is fun, and having access to the Batmobile for the first time gives us a new world of possibilities for interacting with Gotham City. Arkham Knight is an outstanding game on almost every level.",0
"285","Like a big bucket of Hot Wheels brought to life, Forza Motorsport 6 is first-order car porn for the automobile obsessed but remains an accessible and exciting racer for those who just want to drive fast in something red with a horse logo on it.",0
"286","NBA 2K16 is one of the most complete packages I’ve ever seen. Developer Visual Concepts continues to raise the sports simulation bar by completely retooling its silky-smooth gameplay, adding brand-new physics systems, and refining its traditional game modes.",0
"287","Episode 5: The Vault of the Traveler finishes off Rhys and Fiona’s journey in impeccable fashion. From heartbreak to hilarity, it runs the gamut of emotions in some really effective ways.",0
"288","These games have aged remarkably well, they’re still an absolute to play, and their characters are as charming and memorable as ever.",0
"289","Final Fantasy XIV: Heavensward doesn't make sweeping changes to A Realm Reborn aside from new jobs and flying mounts, but the outstanding story it tells and new lands we visit reinvigorate the adventure and demonstrate why Final Fantasy XIV is one of the best MMOs out there.",0
"290","Its beauty is more than skin deep, too. DmC already had one of the most elegant combat-control schemes of any action game to date, but this Definitive Edition adds a lock-on system. That makes it easier to track enemies and execute signature lunge moves like the Stinger, or to focus on the biggest threat in a group of enemies.",0
"291","Very few games can hook me in for 100 hours, but this installment adds enough new creatures, weapons, locations, and fighting moves to expand and reinvigorate my lust for the hunt.",0
"292","With a strong script, great use of FMV, and a simple yet empowering core game mechanic, Her Story is the most unique game I’ve played in years.",0
"293","Homeworld: The Remastered Collection does a fantastic job of polishing up and reintroducing these formerly hard-to-experience classic real-time strategy games.",0
"294","Rise of the Tomb Raider raises the bar set by Lara’s last outing with a rollicking adventure story, strong villains, gorgeous vistas, and smart puzzles – go off the main path to find the best stuff in dastardly optional tombs. Though the mandatory combat doesn’t distinguish itself with challenging enemies unless you crank up the difficulty, Lara’s newfound versatility on the battlefield makes fighting a lot more fun.",0
"295","Steamworld Heist stole my heart. The characters are charming, the combat is addictive, and the Firefly-style adventure made every battle a blast. Besides some annoying instances of post-battle maintenance, I rarely felt the need to power down these robots.",0
"296","An awesome upgrade that's addressed most of my biggest problems with Destiny over the past year.",0
"297","It’s an impressively layered game, and does a great job of tapping deep into the skater psyche, where an obsession with tricks and effortless style intersect.",0
"298","Even though the New 3DS’ speedier hardware can’t make it look quite as good as it does on the Wii, its scope and scale still make it an impressive and deep game that’s well suited for play on the go.",0
"299","Dirt Rally is a brilliant looking and incredible sounding racing sim that feels absolutely outstanding, but it won’t tolerate the timid.",0
"300","Don’t expect exciting scenarios or random events, but do expect to be impressed by the scale and many moving parts of this city-builder.",0
"301","Mega Man Legacy Collection is an object lesson for how game compilations should be engineered, providing rock-solid adaptation to a new platform, respecting the material’s historic context, and exercising restraint.",0
"302","An incredible package. Its presentation is charming, the extras are amazing, and so many of the games included here are still a blast to play.",0
"303","Guardians’ multiplayer harkens back to the Halo 2 glory days with tons of balanced maps and fun modes, and the tactical new Warzone mode absolutely steals the show.",0
"304","Time has done little to diminish Grim Fandango’s beauty or relevance. It is an adventure game not to be missed.",0
"305","Madden NFL 16's new throwing and passing game ramps up the risk, reward, and realism in new, exciting ways.",0
"306","Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster is already great way to play these classic RPGs on the PS3 and Vita, and the even prettier PlayStation 4 version comes with the visual improvements you’d expect for the new-generation platform.",0
"307","The sharper visuals, smooth 60-fps gameplay, and other features and enhancements gave me plenty of reasons to be happy about coming back, and to recommend that you pick it up for the first time.",0
"308","Deep and demanding but incredibly user-friendly, Project CARS looks great, sounds fantastic, and feels even better.",0
"309","Deep and demanding but incredibly user-friendly, Project CARS is real racing done right.",0
"310","Madden NFL 16's new throwing and passing game ramps up the risk, reward, and realism in new, exciting ways.",0
"311","A thrilling turn-based spy game. Though it fails to tap its colorful characters for story material and personality beyond their unique abilities, its randomized maps and spy equipment make sneaking past the enemy AI for maximum profit a tough and repeatable challenge.",0
"312","From its four-player co-op campaign to the brand-new powers and a fleshed-out Zombies mode, Black Ops 3 meaningfully pushes the Call of Duty series forward on several fronts. Even where it doesn't innovate, it still meets the high bar Call of Duty fans should expect.",0
"313","It isn’t the prettiest game you can play on PS4, PS3 or Vita, but Helldivers is one of the most exhilarating, and you’ll get all three versions for the price of one.",0

"318","Its beautiful graphics are prettier than ever, and a higher frame rate adds more fluidity to the action. The story will be confusing to newcomers, as it picks up right in the middle of the saga, but the exciting combat and epic set pieces hold up exceptionally well.",0
"319","Few franchises can get away with feeling this similar from version to version, but Disgaea is just that deep, requiring you to understand and exploit character stats, equipment attributes, and class abilities at a level most modern RPGs have abandoned in the name of accessibility.",0
"320","A few difficulty spikes threaten to spoil the colorful, effervescent fun in Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime’s frantic cooperative 2D-shooter action, but its novel core emphasis on relying on coordination with another player or an AI partner to overcome such challenges is usually strong enough to overcome the occasional frustration.",0
"321","Disney Infinity 3.0 sees the pop culture powerhouse flexing its formidable mega franchise muscles with impressive results. It’s a game that doesn’t just encourage the player to have fun, it insists on it; offering up a generous helping of gameplay and countless things to unlock even before you start piling on all the optional add-ons.",0

"341","Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number is a great game and a worthy sequel. It’s more confident in its style, storytelling ability, and level design than the first game.",0
"342","Its main story is unspectacular, but the memorable side quests and sheer fun of exploring its world do a fantastic job of offsetting that, making Dying Light one of the most engrossing open-world games – zombie-infested or otherwise – I've played in a while.",0

"347","State of Decay deservedly shattered Xbox Live Arcade sales records in 2013: it is a potent mix of RPG gameplay systems that all fuse together to create an unpredictable and tense survival experience. Time hasn’t taken anything away from that for Year One Survival Edition, and though it hasn’t fixed its technical problems either, this zombie-bashing, resource-managing post-apocalyptic gem still stands out from the horde of brainless zombie games.",0
"348","I’ll keep defying gravity as Adrian Neville, and defying expectations as Dolph Ziggler, because WWE 2K16 is as close to a fusion of performance and competition as a wrestling game has ever gotten. That’s what I come to wrestling for, and that’s what 2K16 delivers.",0
"349","A remarkable achievement in blockbuster storytelling and graphical beauty. Though it’s let down by a lack of imagination and some self-indulgence, especially in a third act that drags on far too long, Uncharted 4 carries on the series’ proud tradition of peerless polish and style, with a great multiplayer component to boot. Most importantly, it’s a gentle sendoff to the rag-tag group of characters we’ve known for nine years.",0
"350","Blood and Wine ends the saga of Geralt of Rivia in style, bringing with it a tale of charming vampires and troublesome friendship set in a stunning new landscape that departs from the bleakness we've known until now. The expansion also brings some welcome gameplay enhancements, including mutations, the ability to dye armor, and a vineyard for growing herbs. Most of all, it leaves Geralt in a good place.",0
"351","Overwatch is an incredible achievement in multiplayer shooter design. It bobs and weaves almost perfectly between being the quick-fix adrenaline hit you might want after a long day of work, and the thoughtful, strategic multiplayer experience that becomes the center of evening-long binges with friends. It might not have the most exhaustive list of maps and modes, but it provides nearly endless opportunities for exhilarating, coordinated play. When you’re at the center of it, it feels like nothing else.",0

"356","Unfortunately, Xbox One version does suffer from some slight stuttering in larger areas like the farm, but developer Chucklefish confirms that there is a planned update to fix it within the coming weeks. Otherwise, Stardew Valley for consoles is still the same great game we first played on PC, and comes just as highly recommended.",0

There’s plenty to do while I wait to uncover more of the Valley’s secrets, and the prospect of filling my days with new adventures or just a better harvest is too enticing to pass up.",0

Many of those are smartly revamped versions of Civ classics, buy it finds its own identity with great new ideas like spread-out cities, customizeable governments, research boosts, and leader agendas.

"365","After months of missteps, Legion shows World of Warcraft finding its footing again and asserting its relevance after more than a decade. Many elements make this an expansion worth enjoying, including class halls, gigantic zones filled with memorable stories, better socialization, the actiony new Demon Hunter class, and world quests.",0
"366","Owlboy shines thanks to surprisingly varied, Metroidvania-style gameplay and a charming cast of unlikely heroes whose bittersweet journey is among the best I’ve experienced in recent years.

"372","Stardew Valley's transition to consoles is a smooth one. Both the PS4 and Xbox One versions include the great post-launch updates we've seen in the PC version, like the new farm templates, divorce, bug fixes, and more romance options. The controller mapping is taken from the PC version, so they're familiar, but the mouse cursor that's used to navigate menus is a little on the slow side. Still, most of my time was spent farming, talking with neighbors, or in dungeons, so this wasn't a deterrent for me when playing these versions.",0

"375","Though I would have liked a little bit more originality in its central story, which again revolves around a usurper to the throne, it’s the stories that I’ve created on my own using its many creativity-enabling powers that I’ll remember, every graceful, fumbling, and hilarious one of them. I’m compelled to create many more in the months to come.",0
"376","F1 2016 is definitively the best Formula One game Codemasters has ever crafted.",0
"377","I greatly enjoyed the two or so hours it took me to play through Pony Island. This is a game that delights in toying with your expectations and in breaking the fourth wall, in revealing its sinister yet playful world, and in building up a compelling antagonist and telling an ambiguous story. Pony Island is about as punk rock as they come.",0
"378","It’s rare that a sequel evolves on every part of the original concept so consistently for the better, but Titanfall 2 is that exception.",0
"379","Day of the Tentacle Remastered is a witty, funny, beautiful collection of brain teasers.",0
"380","Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright is a fantastic balance of tactical challenge and accessibility. Even after I finished the story, I found myself returning to the battlefield again and again to unlock more conversations between friends and test my army’s might against Nohr’s finest. I’m addicted to Fire Emblem Fates, and that’s fine by me.",0
"381","Zelda: Twilight Princess HD's graphics can look flat at times, but it's still a great chapter in the series.",0
"382","It is among the very best of the first-person narrative genre, and it reminds us what video game storytelling is capable of in the right hands. It’s a game I can see coming back to every year or two just to revisit its beautiful sights and memorable characters – just like a good book.",0
"383","Superhot VR’s fantastically clever time-manipulating concept empowers you with the superhuman reflexes of a slow-motion action hero. Shattering waves of glass-like enemies while moving your face out of the path of incoming bullets is a thrilling challenge in both the cryptic story mode and the endless mode that follows.",0
"384","Deep and nuanced, stuffed with fan service, and as demanding as you’d like it to be, this is worthy fare for the motorsport obsessed while remaining accessible for the merely curious, and absolutely worth the upgrade from previous years.",0

"386","It takes the characters that we fell in love with long ago, and sets them off on their most gorgeous quest yet. The deep and rewarding weapon system, beautiful and varied worlds, and charming-as-heck story make it an adventure that anyone with a PlayStation 4 should strap in for.",0
"387","Simply put, MLB The Show 16 is the best baseball game available on any current-gen console. It looks, plays, and feels amazing, offering many ways to play the great American pastime. Franchise and Road to the Show modes have made incremental but impressive improvements, while Diamond Dynasty offers entirely new ways to play. Not every mode works, but it’s encouraging to see such a radical new mix of gameplay.",0
"388","Ultimately, Valkyria Chronicles Remastered is a beautifully crafted and original tactical RPG. While this particular package is lacking in special features, it’s still a perfect opportunity to play a charming cult classic at a budget price.",0
"389","While it may not be an amazing capitalism simulator, Planet Coaster is a fantastic theme park-building sandbox that rarely ever took an idea I had and told me, “No, you can’t do that.",0
"390","You could call Salt and Sanctuary a 2D mashup of Dark Souls and Castlevania, and you'd be right. But such a simple pronouncement would be a disservice to the tremendous amount of thought that's gone into Salt and Sanctuary, whether it's in the graphic style that evokes horror through the style of comic strips or in the intricate web of dungeons and castles serves as it map.",0
"391","I never expected to compare Gears of War 4 to The Force Awakens, but I couldn’t be happier to do so. Like the latest chapter in the story from a time long ago in a galaxy far, far away, Gears of War 4 is directed by a new generation of creators, shares a lot of similar narrative structures to the beloved first piece of the trilogy it succeeds, and is an experience you’ll walk away from with a big smile on your face.",0
"392","Darkest Dungeon is a punishing and awesome game of tactics, management, and pushing your luck to the breaking point.",0
"393","Its impeccably designed environments are flush with possibility, remaining completely coherent while supporting a wide variety of routes and character builds, and Jensen’s prodigious new feats of techno-wizardry make add new dimension to both combat and exploration. Mankind Divided never stopped challenging me or rewarding my curiosity, which pushed me to thoroughly explore its beautiful, ruined world while carefully weighing my decisions along the way.",0

"399","Grim Dawn is one of the best action-RPGs out there, combining excellent hack and slash action with a world and progression curve that makes it worth fighting through. Alone or with friends, it’s hour after hour of top quality combat and looting, with the promise of many more excellent dark times to come.",0
"400","Darkest Dungeon is a grim and merciless tactical strategy game whose great tension comes from its many layers of complexity, unpredictable randomization, and willingness to put our fragile characters in mortal danger if we dare to venture into its depths in search of treasure and glory. Brilliant narration and stiff yet surprisingly expressive animation make it easy to be drawn into its vague but tantalizing world, though the end feels artificially out of reach.",0
"401","Its impeccably designed environments are flush with possibility, remaining completely coherent while supporting a wide variety of routes and character builds, and Jensen’s prodigious new feats of techno-wizardry make add new dimension to both combat and exploration.

"402","It’s a brutal, but brilliant shooter that finds strength in its minimalism, stretching a few seconds of action here and there into endless hours of dreadful fun.",0
"403","Multiplayer also benefits from the graphics upgrade, and its refreshingly old-school pace is fun and explosive in its own right. It might not have the same effect it did the first time around, but it works as both a great embodiment of what shooters used to be and one that still plays well.",0
"404","Dragon Quest Builders is totally, thoroughly engaging. Its gameplay is accessible to kids while its dialogue offers enough sly references to keep Dad or Mom amused.",0
"405","Aside from the smaller-feeling plot, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided improves upon its excellent predecessor in every other way.",0
"406","This final chapter brings the beloved Zero Escape trilogy to a gratifying end, featuring beautiful character moments, elaborate puzzles, and a mind-bending plot. Not many games will keep me glued to the screen like Zero Time Dilemma did.",0
"407","Hearts of Iron 4 wields complexity like a swift armor division during the blitzkrieg, allowing it to serve the idea of layered, cerebral, strategic warfare instead of letting it needlessly bog down the experience.",0
"408","Watch Dogs 2’s distinctive hacking and puzzle mechanics do a great job of reminding you that you’re not playing just another Grand Theft Auto clone as you tear through it’s beautiful Bay Area map. Marcus is a bit too friendly of a guy to be believable as our instrument of mayhem, but the flexible missions let you get through mostly non-violently if you’re good enough at stealth. And when it works, multiplayer is good unconventional cat-and-mouse fun, too.",0
"409","The Banner Saga 2 is as beautiful and tactical as the first, but with greater variety in combat and story.",0
"410","The community’s gameplay wishes were granted with a new focus on Franchise mode, led by the Play the Moments feature.

"413","Starbound excels as a crafting and exploration game, as a 2D platformer with varied and engaging combat, and as a Zelda-esque story RPG with a detailed world and memorable alien cultures to interact with. The sheer volume of different kinds of locations to discover, items to craft and build great structures with, and flashy ways to vanquish aliens prevent any part of the experience from getting boring quickly.",0
"414","Quadrilateral Cowboy’s puzzles are mostly a joy to play. Its command line hacking is surprisingly accessible and pleasingly tactile, and when combined with its many interesting gadgets it allows for plenty of creative problem-solving and freedom in tackling all manner of whimsical cybercrime.",0

"420","Hitman Episode 2: Sapienza is a fantastic follow-up to the promising first episode; huge, bursting with deadly promise, and begging for many, many playthroughs.",0
"421","Housemarque’s previous games have always kept me coming back through the strength of their gameplay alone. Alienation adds a straightforward, but enjoyable power chase on top, making its finely tuned arcade action all the more alluring. Its action-RPG elements won’t make it a replacement for something like Diablo 3 or Grim Dawn, but they successfully provide a structure for unending, enjoyable alien slaughter.",0
"422","Put simply, I love Deserts of Kharak. It succeeds where so many RTS games fail, giving a multitasking commander all of the information, unit options, and control flexibility needed to remove needless barriers between what your brain wants your army to do, and what it’s actually able to execute at a moment’s notice.",0
"423","Wang's stupid wisecracks kept me smiling from start to finish, and the variety of melee and ranged combat and the loot that dropped from it was satisfying enough that I came back with friends for more. It's great fun in solo or in co-op, and its small degree of randomization is enough to keep the action fresh for at least a few runs.",0
"424","The most gaming fun I’ve had with either series in years. The story is great, the levels are dense with fun puzzles, and unlocking all of the secrets is a blast.",0
"425","Designing, flying, and then retrying missions again and again is a tough challenge that goes right up to the brink of frustration (and sometimes beyond the limits of the PlayStation 4’s performance), but the eventual success of achieving virtual space flight is rewarding and even inspirational.",0
"426","Firewatch is amazing for many reasons, but above all because it’s an adult game that deals with serious issues, with realistic adult dialogue to match. And it deals with those issues just like actual adults would: sometimes with humor, sometimes with anger, and sometimes with sadness.",0
"427","When I eventually, inevitably crashed, I was always hammering restart the moment the prompt appeared. That’s the mark of an amazing puzzle game.",0
"428","Virginia shows instead of tells, with a raw, understated power and a calculated nuance that make even the smallest, most mundane details brim with narrative and emotional significance.",0
"429","An amazing game for all the same reasons I mentioned in our original review. It’s still a gorgeous kart racer and every bit as addictive as it was in 2014. This is the best entry in the series so far, and it has all the content you’ll need. Returning players have seen a lot of this game before, but the overhauled Battle mode and its five additional ways to play are a great reason to pick it up. Nintendo didn’t do enough to make the online experience better, but the rest of this game holds up well.",0
"430","This is the best version of Shovel Knight yet, and Treasure Trove is the most complete package. In addition to piling ever more new features on top of the original, Yacht Club has improved on Shovel Knight in nearly every way with the Specter of Torment expansion. From the story and writing to the simple fluidness of platforming and combat, Specter Knight is an excellent new step for the series.",0
"431","Rich with details and faithful to just about everything that makes contemporary F1 tick, F1 2017 is about as good a simulation of a single, modern motorsport as you can get.",0
"432","Stormblood doesn't do much to shake up the general design Final Fantasy XIV has followed since its relaunch, but never before have its familiar elements worked quite so well.",0
"433","Lone Echo and Echo Arena are the rare games that demonstrate the true value of VR and hand tracking. Its sense of movement feels great, and it couldn’t exist in any other way. Lone Echo’s well-acted story and interesting environments move at a slow enough pace that you can soak it all in and appreciate the sensation of virtual weightlessness before jumping into the fast, sweaty, competitive action of Echo Arena. The fact that you can experience the multiplayer without even buying it means it’s one of the first things any Oculus Rift owner should download.",0
"434","Across a vast and beautiful open world, Horizon: Zero Dawn juggles many moving parts with polish and finesse. Its main activity - combat - is extremely satisfying thanks to the varied design and behaviors of machine-creatures that roam its lands, each of which needs to be taken down with careful consideration. Though side questing could have been more imaginative, its missions are compelling thanks to a central mystery that led me down a deep rabbit hole to a genuinely surprising - and moving - conclusion.",0
"435","In our testing on live servers the online multiplayer was as solid as a Kryptonian, with minimal frame delay and no freezing or lag stutters.",0
"436","Though it only took me just under two hours to complete, the second the credits stopped rolling I immediately restarted What Remains of Edith Finch. Each of the vignettes is so distinct and surprising that I didn’t have enough time to absorb and dissect what I had just played before being whisked away to the next one. But after fully piecing together the threads of the family and sifting through the allegories of their final moments, I was left with a beautiful, heartbreaking mosaic that exudes life, even when mired in death.",0

"439","Everything that made Wolfenstein: The New Order an excellent single-player first-person shooter is dialed up for round two. With a cast of instantly likeable heroes and bone-chilling villains giving emotional context to its bloody uprising against high-tech Nazis, Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus has come to play.",0
"440","Nier: Automata is a crazy, beautiful, and highly entertaining journey full of nutty ideas and awesome gameplay. It may not include the most sensical story or compelling characters, but its frenzied combat -- coupled with beautiful visuals and a stunning soundtrack – make it too much fun to pass up.",0
"441","SteamWorld Dig 2 retains the original’s addictive resource-gathering gameplay, but supplements it with a gorgeously detailed, handcrafted world. Its heady mix of exploration, combat, platforming, and puzzle solving, alongside an expansive set of abilities and mods gives it plenty of variety and a great gameplay rhythm. I wish there was more to do once the campaign ends, but that’s a testament to the fact that what is here is just about pitch perfect.",0
"442","Its ability to swerve from the amusing hijinks of its vibrant heroes into very real, and very serious subject matter without feeling forced or unnatural was a pleasant surprise that kept me invested in its character drama long after I’d said goodbye to Possum Springs for the first time. But just like Mae, I know I’ll be back soon.",0
"443","You'll find some boring sidequests, yes, but it makes up for that flaw with an unforgettable story filled with moving cutscenes and acting, great new primal fights and dungeons, two wonderful new combat classes, and new lands that reward the explorer in us all.",0
"444","The unrivaled amount of single-player content to explore, especially the highlight Multiverse mode, and the height of Injustice 2’s skill ceiling make it an easy environment in which to lose hours of your day without ever even challenging another human… or giant telekinetic gorilla, as it were.",0
"445","Night in the Woods captures the fears and anxieties of being a young adult with surprising clarity, but brings it into new and interesting territory thanks to its developers’ deep understanding of rural America’s economic hardships. Branching, well-written dialogue made me feel closer to Mae’s story as I helped build out her history and reignite friendships, encouraging a second playthrough to uncover the scenes (and even a few secrets) I know I missed.",0
"446","Hollow Knight is a Metroidvania with a well of content to discover that’s as deep as its labyrinthine caves. The world of Hallownest is compelling and rich, full of story that’s left for you to discover on your own, and built with branching paths that offer an absurd amount of choice in how you go about discovering it. With such a high density of secrets to find and fun, challenging enemies to face, it’s worth spending every moment you can in Hollow Knight.",0
"447","A fantastic single-player shooter, but what really got me invested was the brilliantly written characters and the performances of its cast. BJ and his crew are full of spirit and personality, and General Engel is as memorable a nemesis as you’re likely to find in games. Machine Games has once again turned the well-worn act of mowing down Nazis into something to get excited about.",0
"448","Destiny 2 is a blast out of the gate thanks to its excellent co-op shooter gameplay and strong storytelling in the campaign. Not all the features I’d expected to find are here, but it does deliver the same kind of highly social gameplay and rewarding, loot-driven progression that helped the original keep me hooked for hundreds of hours. The main concerns right now are a few bugs and lack of event options, but I’ll definitely be sticking around to see this big, action-packed universe develop over time.",0
"449","The story and objective-driven campaign is a league above anything we’ve seen in the entire Total War series before in both design and presentation.",0
"450","A delightful, daring, and different expansion that reinforces Forza Horizon 3’s reputation as one of the best racing games ever made.",0
"451","But it’s the music and sounds of Thumper that will stick with me the most, beckoning me back to that terrifying abyss for several more hours to come.",0
"452","While I did notice some occasional rubberbanding on the Switch while playing on the go – which is likely a symptom of having to use WiFi in handheld mode – the majority of my online matches were smooth and consistent and all platforms.",0
"453","Rich with details and faithful to just about everything that makes contemporary F1 tick, F1 2017 is about as good a simulation of a single, modern motorsport as you can get.",0
"454","Cuphead made me feel more good and more bad than any other game I’ve played in the last several years. I swore, laughed, and hollered with delight. I hated it (and my own fingers) for long stretches but, having finished, I realise that’s more or less the point – I emerged from all that pain smiling. Rather than simply offering the player what they want, Cuphead makes them earn that right – the rewards, if you can hack the tests, are absolutely worth it. Cuphead is incredible for more than just its looks. But before you dive in, make sure you actually want a game that plays like this, and not just a game that looks like this.",0
"455","The outstanding classic-style RPG Pillars of Eternity makes a surprisingly virtuosic transition to the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 with the Complete Edition, bringing both systems all of the content that's been released on the PC version so far.",0
"456","Final Fantasy XII’s relatable roleplaying adventure has aged remarkably well, and The Zodiac Age remaster improves it further in meaningful ways. The storytelling, visual design, and gameplay feel just as fresh and interesting as they did over a decade ago, and the various new enhancements and adjustments will give new players a chance to experience the magic for the first time and fans of the original something enticing to return for.",0
"457","A fantastic single-player shooter, but what really got me invested was the brilliantly written characters and the performances of its cast.

"458","It truly is the classic throwback longtime series fans have been clamoring for, but there’s plenty to love here even if you didn’t grow up with a Genesis. Sonic Mania is a stellar example of a retro revival done right.",0
"459","Robo Recall is an excellent demonstration of what a VR shooter can be on Oculus Touch. Thanks to highly physical action and tons of options for smashing a bunch of great-looking robots with both magically replenishing guns and your bare hands, the three available maps feel like plenty.",0
"460","Accessible yet tough and grimy yet gorgeous, Dirt 4 sets a new standard in rally racing – and its well-considered career mode and endless stages inject it with tremendous stamina. Absolutely stonking brilliant.",0
"461","Microsoft pitched Forza Motorsport 7 as the ultimate automotive playset, and it’s hard to argue otherwise. With enough cars to fill a dozen museums and the most generous selection of tracks to date in the series, the amount of driving, experimenting, and racing here is absolutely mammoth. Accessible as always for beginners but crammed with content targeted at lifelong car junkies, Forza Motorsport 7 is Turn 10’s finest love letter to speed and style this generation, no matter what language you speak.",0
"462","Like 1-2-Switch and Graceful Explosion Machine, Thumper uses the Switch’s HD Rumble feature to add a subtle texture to the physical feedback. It really feels like you’re scraping against the edges of the track and slamming into its sharp turns, which adds to the physical brutality that makes Thumper so distinct.",0
"463","While it’s been marketed as a remake of Metroid II: The Return of Samus for Game Boy, Metroid: Samus Returns is more of a much-needed reboot of the 2D Metroid games we know and love. It’s a safe, modern take on Super Metroid, one of the greatest games of all time. Aside from some repetitive boss fights and hand-cramping controls, it’s nearly everything I could ask for as a fan of old-school Metroids.",0
"464","Dragon Quest VIII was one of the finest JRPGs upon its initial release and it manages to retain that lofty status through this 3DS edition. Its adherence to the traditional rules of the genre is where it pulls its strength from, the familiarity of the template allowing the design team to worry about making sure each element is as good as it can possibly can be.",0

"466","Assassin’s Creed Origins is a deep-dive into a truly stunning realization of ancient Egypt, with a rich series of cultures, genuine characters, and more mission variety than any other game in the series.",0
"467","The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+ adds more of what we loved about the original and keeps the formula fresh. It’s a tough game, but one that balances challenge with a refreshing feeling of the unexpected. The unpredictable items and varied enemies make it one of the most wacky and replayable games I’ve ever experienced.",0
"468","SteamWorld Dig 2 retains the original’s addictive resource-gathering gameplay, but supplements it with a gorgeously detailed, handcrafted world. Its heady mix of exploration, combat, platforming, and puzzle solving, alongside an expansive set of abilities and mods gives it plenty of variety and a great gameplay rhythm. I wish there was more to do once the campaign ends, but that’s a testament to the fact that what is here is just about pitch perfect.",0
"469","While its melee combat may lag slightly behind modern genre standards, Yakuza 0 still hits far more than it misses and is a big, bold and bruising tour through the Japanese underworld.",0
"470","Destiny 2 is a blast out of the gate thanks to its excellent co-op shooter gameplay and strong storytelling in the campaign. Not all the features I’d expected to find are here, but it does deliver the same kind of highly social gameplay and rewarding, loot-driven progression that helped the original keep me hooked for hundreds of hours. The main concerns right now are a few bugs and lack of event options, but I’ll definitely be sticking around to see this big, action-packed universe develop over time.",0
"471","StarCraft remains a titan of the genre for a reason. Though its interface lacks some contemporary conveniences, Blizzard has still, to this day, failed to outdo itself in terms of the elegant balance between three highly asymmetrical factions that was achieved in Brood War. Whether you want to revisit the glory days or see a piece of gaming history for the first time, StarCraft Remastered is a trip well worth taking.",0
"472","Accessible yet tough and grimy yet gorgeous, Dirt 4 sets a new standard in rally racing – and its well-considered career mode and endless stages inject it with tremendous stamina. Absolutely stonking brilliant.",0
"473","Project CARS 2 plays like a pumped-up version of the classic TOCA Race Driver 3 from 2006, redressing many of the complaints levelled at the original.",0
"474","These upgraded versions not only have everything I enjoyed about Sun and Moon, but augments them in important ways by making small but meaningful changes to the story, expanding the selection of available Pokemon, and even making some small tweaks to the world. Unless you played through both Sun and Moon extensively and have already collected every Legendary Pokemon, it’s easy to recommend to any Pokemon fan.",0
"475","Another epic-length episode of the humor that’s kept fans of the show laughing for 20 years.",0
"476","Gorogoa crafts its inventive, sliding-tile puzzles and magical world with a graceful simplicity across a compact but fulfilling adventure. The excitement of solving each puzzle may be lost on a repeat playthrough, but its hand-drawn art and clever payoffs are no less satisfying to watch unfold again and again. Gorogoa manages to say so much without uttering a single word, endowing it with a mystery that invites a more attentive, thoughtful revisit — and one that I was more than happy to accept.",0
"477","You certainly get your $20’s worth out of Thimbleweed Park. The voice cast doesn’t elevate the script in the way they always did in the LucasArts “talky” days, but an enjoyable, self-referential story and hundreds of puzzles to solve make it worthy of a place on your shelf next to Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island.",0

"480","Now and then I’ll encounter a display quirk or a bug that may botch a race start, and the AI desperately needs a lesson in first corners, but when I’m out on track wringing ten-tenths out of my car against just the right AI level – one eye on the car ahead and the other on the clouds above – this is about as good as real racing gets right now.",0
"481","The combat is challenging and thoughtful, and while the loot system doesn’t match up to games like Destiny 2, there are enough different weapon types and enough enemy variety to keep you swapping between weapons, catered to the situation. The RPG elements encourage challenges of their own, and even despite a handful of bugs, I desperately wanted to keep playing.",0
"482","Whether playing online or off, there’s a huge amount to do here and a huge amount to love about it. Put the effort in and you’re repaid with a genuine sense of satisfaction and a feeling of real accomplishment. Once again, PES has set an incredibly high level of quality for other sports games to try and match.",0
"483","The beautifully presented Puyo Puyo Tetris has a ton of content, a really fun multiplayer with a lot of variations, and is very easy to pick up and play with just about anyone despite the slight balance issues. The Nintendo Switch is a great platform for it too, with its portability and non-threatening Joy-Con controllers. This is the type of game that offers an adequate challenge for even the most hardcore puzzle players with its Challenge modes, but is inviting for even the smallest of children and gaming newbies.",0
"484","Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is a standout RPG that manages to keep its story, combat, and exploration interesting over the course of at least 70 hours of adventure through an impressively varied and rich world. Getting from place to place can be confusing, but outside of that and a multi-hour progression roadblock near the end this is an excellent game full of tough, memorable battles and a positive message.",0
"485","An excellent addition to an amazing game. Developer Guerrilla has doubled down on the thrill of the hunt with more challenging machines and testing side quests that are added to the original map through an intriguing new storyline that delves into the mystical side of this post-apocalyptic world. It left me wanting start a brand new game, just to wander around the world, marveling at it.",0
"486","Like Hide and Seek, Little Nightmares confidently captures the exhilarating fear of waiting to be found by something that’s hunting you. But it also replicates the alien horror of being a child that doesn’t understand what’s happening to and around them, and of a seemingly familiar environment turned into a series of opportunities for safety and danger. Smart, grotesque and never-endingly weird, this is a very different, extremely welcome kind of horror game that left me wanting more than its brief five hours provides.",0

"488","Steel Division: Normandy '44 succeeds both at being an entertaining real-time tactics game and a compelling simulation of historical combat, which is a remarkable combination. Not to get ahead of things, but playing this excellent World War II game makes it hard not to get excited about the potential of Steel Division: Stalingrad '42 or Rome '43. Future games or expansions might even smooth out Normandy ‘44’s small drawbacks, specifically its occasionally overwhelming amount of detail and lack of context to its huge number of options, but its successes wildly outweigh its failures.",0
"489","Rockstar’s done a great job of retooling it to make LA Noire: The VR Case Files feel less like a port and more like something that was always meant to be played this way, and the effort shows.",0
"490","The handling has been tuned to a T, the content is excellently curated, and the amount of variety and racing available in it is delightfully daunting. Even if you don’t care about the developer’s esports aspirations there’s still a mammoth solo racer here that’s always ready to roll whenever you are.",0
"491","A great new story mode makes it at least a significant improvement, even if it’s more incremental than we’d hoped from a new game engine.",0

"493","The shift to the Frostbite Engine definitely lets Madden NFL 18 look fantastic, and Longshot makes great use of that to tell a short but powerful against-all-odds story.",0
"494","The turn-based combat may be a little disappointing, but Torment: Tides of Numenera manages to live up to the legacy of Planescape: Torment by offering a fascinatingly weird and well-written tale. Thanks to a wide variety of options in conversations and the influences of its tidal system, it offers decent opportunities for replay value and a memorable tale each time. This is the rare game that leans almost entirely on its setting and writing for its appeal, and the miraculous thing is that it usually succeeds.",0
"495","A masterclass of atmosphere, storytelling, and the marriage of mechanical and conceptual design. While there are moments that feel shoehorned in to remind us we’re playing a videogame, the care and attention Ninja Theory has clearly poured into Senua and her story has created something amazing. This is a game everyone should play, and I’m thankful for the opportunity to have lived inside the mind of Senua, however briefly.",0

"497","Similar to the way Batman: Arkham City built on the foundation of Arkham Asylum, Middle-earth: Shadow of War is bigger and more ambitious in scope than Shadow of Mordor, with great results. The way it expands the Nemesis system with far greater variety and fortress sieges makes even better use of the stand-out generated characters, and its battles with memorable uruk captains remain challenging all the way through the campaign and into the clever asynchronous multiplayer beyond.",0

"501","But it also results in the incredible visual and aural overhaul and the gameplay tweaks to earlier entries, like time trials and crate counters, that Naughty Dog added later in the series. Those additions make the overall package so much more cohesive while never forgetting what made, and what still makes, so much of Naughty Dog’s original trilogy a blast to play.",0

"503","Another epic-length episode of the humor that’s kept fans of the show laughing for 20 years. The Marvel vs DC parody delivers regular laugh-out-loud moments with only a few faltering gags, and the combat soon evolves into something much more complex and interesting than The Stick of Truth’s simple system. Navigation and repetition of some of its simple puzzle mechanics drag a little, but it’s otherwise an excellent South Park game that’s also a strong RPG.",0
"504","Tales of Berseria is a surprisingly strong showing for this long-running series. Its tragic story of broken people fighting on the wrong side of history makes it utterly compelling, and its well-tuned combat more than makes up for its lack of interesting environments. Simply put, this is a tale too heartbreaking to miss, or to forget.",0

"506","I absolutely thoroughly enjoyed my more than 50 hours with Monster Hunter Stories so far. It effectively eliminates the oh-so-common boring RPG grind, implements a novel turn-based battle system, and sincerely surprises me with seemingly limitless customizability. Though wrapped in a pleasant, sugary coating, Monster Hunter Stories did all of this while retaining the spirit of the Monster Hunter world with some small yet enjoyable nods to fans. I can’t wait to dive back into the endgame and hatch myself a Kirin.",0

"509","Tacoma successfully overcomes the challenge of featuring eight characters and making them all interesting in a relatively short game. Using the out-of-sequence AR recordings to learn about the exciting events on Tacoma is a unique way to see every side of a conversation, and it’s one I hope to see catch on. I would have appreciated more time and events that'd have given me a reason to explore more of the beautiful station, but the time I did have in this fascinating hypothetical future was great.",0

"512","When the bones hit the dirt, I’d rank the Necromancer highly in terms of sheer fun factor and uniqueness when compared to Diablo 3’s other classes. I do feel like $15 might be a bit much to simply unlock a new class, especially when so much of the new stuff in this patch (like some new areas for adventure mode) is being released for free. If it’s within your budget, though, I don’t think you’ll be disappointed with the new playstyles and crazy strategies Rise of the Necromancer brings to Sanctuary.",0
"513","Superhot VR’s fantastically clever time-manipulating concept empowers you with the superhuman reflexes of a slow-motion action hero. Shattering waves of glass-like enemies while moving your face out of the path of incoming bullets is a thrilling challenge in both the cryptic story mode and the endless mode that follows.",0

"515","Bomber Crew is an exciting, in-depth management sim with a charming style that offsets the occasionally brutal difficulty of keeping your crew alive and trying to hit a target, all in real time. A rewarding upgrade cycle makes some trial-and-error frustration worthwhile, and once you get into the groove you can lose hours to its enjoyable rhythm.",0
"516","Guardians of the Galaxy is definitely starting off on the right foot, with a great script, great actors, and a universe packed with personality (and backed by catchy tunes) to explore. If it can continue to deliver the quality of dialogue and panel-perfect action over the course of the rest of the season, it may find itself seated in the upper echelons of Telltale’s catalog.

"518","I can definitely feel that end-of-series crunch happening in Who Needs You, where all the many choices I’ve made have to converge back together to fit a limited number of endings. It comes across a bit heavy-handed in setting the stage for what seems like a somewhat predictable final chapter, but Telltale has surprised me before. As a standalone adventure, it’s definitely up there with Episode 1 as something I’d play over a couple more times, not just to explore different choices but because it’s simply fun and exciting. The fact that it pulls very few emotional punches left me feeling a bit worn out, but also with a glowing sense of anticipation for the sprint to the finish and tying it all together.",0

It has an absurd amount to play, fight, and unlock – though that can be to its detriment at times.

"523","The wide variety of mech and pilot abilities make Into The Breach’s tactical combat deep, satisfying, and replayable. Every turn creates a new complex puzzle, and though sometimes there’s no perfect solution, finding the best way to minimize damage creates frequent eureka moments as you learn to make the most of the abilities you’re given to work with. It’s a small-looking tactics game that’s kept me playing more intently than most big ones.",0
"524","Who would think that a new version of a simple game like Tetris could deliver such a thoroughly absorbing experience? The merging of time-tested gameplay with the synesthesia-inducing sound and visual design of Tetsuya Mizuguchi creates something you’ve likely never experienced. While Tetris Effect’s diverse and beautiful presentation can sometimes literally get in the way of the gameplay, this is proof that even after 30+ years, Tetris can still feel fresh.",0

"528","Subnautica is a template for what open-world survival games should strive to be. It’s fantastical, fresh, and frightening from surface to seabed, with a story that kept on surprising me and a cast of sea monsters that quite literally haunted my dreams. Even with more than 50 hours sunk, I have yet to discover all of its secrets. It’s a testament to how enticing those secrets are that I’m willing to face my fears and plunge my submersible into the darkest corners of its unforgiving ocean again and again.",0
"529","Street Fighter 5 Arcade Edition marks the completion of a transformation from bare-bones fighting game with a rock-solid core to a fully featured example of the genre at its best.

"530","Between the accessible auto combos, homing attacks, and simplified command inputs, Dragon Ball FighterZ is an inviting gateway into the world of fighting games for newcomers — whether you’re a Dragon Ball fan or not.

"535","As far as online play goes, my experience has been about 50/50. There were times when it was so smooth I might as well have been playing against someone right next to me. Other times, it was an infuriating lag-fest that would usually end with a disconnect.",0

"537","Civilization VI is as brilliant a 4X strategy game on Switch as it is on PC, tablets, or phones. With touch and Joy-Con controls that work reasonably well in both handheld and docked modes, I wouldn't be too upset about an even longer commute because it would give me more time to play a few turns.",0
"538","Dragon Quest XI excels when it emphasizes fighting bad guys, exploring dungeons, and finding treasure. It’s a visual feast populated by a cast of colorful monsters more engrossing than its main characters. Uneven story beats and some icky bits sometimes slow Dragon Quest down, but superb mechanics remain the focus, making Echoes of an Elusive Age a top-tier JRPG for the modern age.",0

"544","Thus far, Bungie has delivered on all fronts and even admitted its mistakes with the launch and first year of Destiny 2. Now it’s not only brought back what made me love the first Destiny when it was at its best, but also added a ton of requests that fans – myself included – have wanted for years.",0
"545","Capcom may have inflated the value of this collection by making some of these games so hard to come by up until now, but it still earns high marks because of the high-quality emulation for four classic platformers and plethora of extras.",0

"547","Despite some minor issues, the soul of Soulcalibur 6 is so strong that they don’t do much to bring down what is one of the best entries in the series. The new Reversal Edge and Soul Charge mechanics add new layers of strategy and mind games while the one-two punch of Libra of Soul and Soul Chronicle will provide hours upon hours of fantastic single-player content.

"550","A big step outside of what we’re used to seeing from Assassin’s Creed Origins, and it pulls its whimsically mystical journey off well. Combat continues to be fun and challenging, and this time your biggest foes are fleshed out and varied enough to turn what could’ve easily been a monotonous series of fights into a highlight.",0
"551","Black Ops 4 has a few rough edges, but any of its three modes make for an enjoyable shooter experience that feel distinct and personalized.",0

"555","For many, basketball is more than just a game, and NBA 2K19 doesn’t take that lightly. It throws every resource it has into the theatrics of the sport, creating charismatic presentation, a well-written story mode, and strong core gameplay. The series’ persistent weaknesses are still apparent in areas like the transition game and ludicrous microtransactions, but there’s so much variety to how its extensive MyLeague mode plays out that there’s always a reason to look forward to the next game of basketball.",0
"556","Octopath Traveler is a JRPG dream come true. Both its battle system and aesthetic pay loving tribute to the Super NES era while moving the formula forward in exciting and novel ways. This isn’t merely a modern retread of past classics, but a phenomenal homage with genuinely fresh ideas in a fantastically charming wrapper of old-school meets new. While the eight different character stories could’ve used a little more connection between them, I’m looking forward to going back to complete them all, explore the many side areas, battle optional bosses, and unlock the final job classes.",0

"559","I would have liked a little more incentive to explore the beautiful world Eidos Montreal has created, but I’d much prefer too much content than too little. There’s so much to enjoy elsewhere in a game that’s stuffed to the brim with ideas and devilishly challenging puzzles. I can’t wait to see where Lara goes next.",0

"561","NHL 19 has something for everyone, packing tons of quality into its many fun and diverse modes.",0
"562","It adds a handful of new and interesting mechanics to its tactical battles, nearly all of which improve the formula in tangible ways, but otherwise plays it fairly safe.",0
"563","You could call Salt and Sanctuary a 2D mashup of Dark Souls and Castlevania, and you'd be right. But such a simple pronouncement would be a disservice to the tremendous amount of thought that's gone into Salt and Sanctuary, whether it's in the graphic style that evokes horror through the style of comic strips or in the intricate web of dungeons and castles serves as it map.",0
"564","The successful transition from exotic locales to America’s backyard makes me excited to see where the Far Cry formula goes next.",0
"565","Toys for Bob has done a great job of filling Spyro’s first three adventures with such reinvigorated life. Worlds a are packed to the brim with more detail, animations are consistently endearing, and the quality of life improvements make revisiting these once analog stick-less platformers a joy to play. They’re definitely easier thanks to some of those changes, but no less charming to play.",0
"566","Octo Expansion throws plenty of both fun and serious challenges at you, between its expansive amount of levels and a multi-tiered finale that doesn’t disappoint. These trials provide worthy so many challenges for those who wish to hone their mechanical skills for upcoming multiplayer matches, that I wish this had been Splatoon 2’s base campaign all along.",0
"567","The strength of the MLB The Show series has always been its authentic gameplay, which traditionally does a fantastic job capturing the essence of baseball. The 2018 version of The Show continues that trend, creating the most realistic baseball game to date. However, the nuanced gameplay and visual changes don’t quite make up for the lack of innovation – or removal – of MLB The Show’s core modes.",0
"568","Treasure Tracker still feels close to unique, and gains new life on both of Nintendo’s current systems. Switch is very much the better choice, but 3DS is by no means a bad option. Still smart, prettier than ever and, in retrospect, genuinely important as part of Nintendo’s modern history, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker is a rare example of a game that actually feels better for being a few years old.",0
"569","Ashen’s handful of new ideas make it a stellar Souls-like with solid combat, a great art style, and an interesting world.",0
"570","It still works as a solo adventure, but is far more enjoyable if played with a partner. And despite its oh-so-cute appearance, the generous helping of brilliant Challenge levels attest that Unravel Two has really been made by a talented group of Scandinavian sadists.",0
"571","Overcooked 2 serves up a great balance of hilarious chaos and strategy alongside meaningful improvements over its predecessor. The kitchens have more moving parts, the recipes are more varied, and the ability to throw ingredients fundamentally changes the arcade cooking formula.

Katamari Damacy was a breath of fresh air on first release and it still is today, almost 15 years later.",0
"574","Madden 19 returns the primary focus where it belongs: that moment-to-moment gameplay between the end zones. It’s only true stumbling point is the lackluster story mode that fails to recapture the magic of the first, but that's entirely offset by the new player handling that once again leverages the power of the Frostbite engine.",0
"575","Far Cry 5 is another wide-open playground with all the necessary ingredients for causing a real ruckus: loads of enemies and allies, temperamental wildlife, and plenty of explosions. Amidst all the insanity it manages to tell a serious story with respectable characters and a powerful ending, though it’s not the most memorable in the series.",0
"576","NHL 19 has something for everyone, packing tons of quality into its many fun and diverse modes.",0

With Real Player Motion delivering a fluid on-the-field experience, and Franchise mode customization offering another level of realism, Madden is in a great place.",0
"578","Insurgency: Sandstorm isn’t the prettiest shooter of 2018, but the places where it excels are the places that matter most. Its gunplay is superb, its arsenal is exemplary, and the maps and modes are serviceable enough to facilitate its memorably frantic and immersive FPS combat.",0
"579","While its core story might not have the emotional punch of the original, Unravel Two improves upon the original in every other respect. The platforming is more responsive and demanding, while the puzzles are far more inventive and satisfying to solve, which is largely due to the excellent implementation of a second character and co-op. It still works as a solo adventure, but is far more enjoyable if played with a partner.",0

"581","Artifact is a challenging, deep, and surprisingly approachable card game that breaks many of the conventions I’ve come to expect from the genre. That mechanical bliss is complemented by countless Easter eggs and detailed lore, but I am starting to miss a more meaningful progression system to keep me engaged long term. Its physical card game model has ended up being one of the more reasonable around, and the completely level playing field of Draft mode is so fun it’s worth the price of admission even if you don’t want to spend another cent.",0
"582","With a story that manages to satisfactorily tread the line between high-concept fun and grounded character exploration, Shadow of the Tomb Raider meaningfully wraps up the journey Lara began in 2013 and convincingly leaves her in a place resembling where she was when we were first introduced to her more than 20 years ago.",0
"583","Call of Cthulhu is a dark ride through a mad, cosmic horror nightmare with a paranormal detective story as your vehicle. Occasionally poor level and encounter design can make the eerily atmospheric road a little bumpy, but the engaging mystery and an intriguing utilization of RPG mechanics make it one of the more enjoyable Lovecraftian games in years.",0
"584","Makes the original look like the prototype it was. It's filled with a larger cast of characters vividly brought to life through brilliant writing and some of the best voice acting in video games...From the beginning of the single-player story to the end of the co-op mode, Portal 2 is a novel, unforgettable experience.",1
"585","Featuring the same kind of thrilling freedom of choice The Elder Scrolls series is known for along with beautiful visuals and a stirring soundtrack, playing Skyrim is a rare kind of intensely personal, deeply rewarding experience, and one of the best role-playing games yet produced.",1
"586","If the graphical boost isn't enough - and let's be honest, we're already seeing some games on the 3DS that look better than this - you're not going to have much else to satisfy your interests. It's clear this game is being released to find a new generation of gamers that are just discovering Nintendo's franchises. The rest of us will have to determine if it's worth re-visiting a Hyrule we've known for nearly 13 years.",1
"587","The voice acting, the challenges, the amazing opening, the unbelievable ending and the feeling of being the Dark Knight -- these are the things that standout looking back. I've beaten this thing twice and still want to call in sick and chase Riddler Trophies.",1
"588","With an expertly balanced difficulty progression, dazzling level design and masterful Power-Ups, this is the ideal 3DS experience...As a whole, 3D Land is brilliant and addictive, and should do for 3D-enhanced platforming what the original Super Mario Bros. did for 2D platforming. If you own a 3DS system, you have no choice - you simply must own this game.",1
"589","Buy it. Love it. And get to work making some of your very own Pushmo, because I want to play them.",1
"590","A perfectly paced finale to a story we've all been invested in from the get go.",1
"591","An absolutely amazing game, one that successfully puts a bow on the Mass Effect trilogy while still leaving us hungry for even more. It looks and plays great, but Mass Effect 3's true strength lies in its ability to tell a deeply-woven story.",1
"592","So many systems from previous Diablo titles have been improved, making for an approachable, rewarding and deeply satisfying treasure hunting game. It's addictive on a level few games can match, so much so that it's easy to largely overlook its flaws.",1
"593","It's downright gorgeous and a total blast to play alone or with friends. A truly realized vision at the top of its genre, Rayman Origins is an extravaganza with plenty of action to keep it fresh from start to finish and beyond.",1
"594","The puzzles are clever and addictive, and the new sliding mechanic, new gadgets and updated camera controls do a bang-up job of making this experience feel fresh and distinct. This game is a must download for any 3DS owner, especially fans of the puzzle genre.",1
"595","Mass Effect 3 on its own is still easily one of the best games of the year – and some (like me) would argue that it's the best game in the trilogy – and that hasn't changed on Wii U. The only thing that's changed is your access to the rest of the series.",1
"596","Batman: Arkham City isn't perfect, but listing the little things I didn't like gets in the way of all the stuff I adored.",1
"597","There should be no timeline ever created that doesn't contain you playing this game.",1
"598","Looks beautiful, runs well, totes short load times and has a great soundtrack. That's all well and good, but what makes the game so damn good is its addicting, twitch dual analog gameplay. Something tells me that many a PlayStation Vita gamer will have an incredibly hard time putting down Super Stardust Delta, if not for the gameplay then for the hyper-competitive nature of the leaderboards.",1
"599","The PC version, as run on mid-range hardware, makes no such visual compromises, with gorgeous high-resolution textures, detailed faces, and smooth performance...A brilliant shooter that nudges the entire genre forward with innovations in both storytelling and gameplay.",1
"600","It fulfills the promise of a multiplayer Mario much better than anything that the Japanese game maker has done before. Super Mario 3D World is marvelous, and its constant variety and fantastic light-hearted co-op play proves that Nintendo still knows exactly how to tweak their Mario formula in fun ways.",1
"601","Fire Emblem Awakening is the most fluid and stunning strategy RPG experience available on a portable, and features the best storytelling and production value of any 3DS game to date.",1
"602","The sum of Fez’s intelligent level designs, perception mechanic, massive number of stages and secrets, and incredible art is so much more than just a shout-out to old-school gaming. Fez is a game in love with games.",1
"603","Whether you’ve never heard of Flower or you replay it regularly, the PlayStation 4 version is an excellent, unforgettable return to one of PlayStation’s finest games. It’s still profound, and now it looks and feels better than ever. For those who appreciate experimental artistry, Flower’s zen exploration is as good as it gets.",1
"604","Holds up as a marvelous game full of unique and wonderful surprises that remind me why it’s the best of the 3D Zeldas.",1
"605","New Leaf is a truly magical game, one that you can easily expect to invest hundreds of hours in over the course of years. Anyone with access to a 3DS should absolutely give this game a try - just be prepared to kiss your “real” life goodbye.",1
"606","Gone Home is a remarkable achievement, and piecing together its poignant story will stick with me forever.",1
"607","SteamWorld Dig is easily the best eShop game of the year.",1
"608","I’m glad to have had a reason to revisit it, and am happy to find it even more impressive than it was before.",1
"609","Its world is a truly astonishing achievement in so many ways, and these two versions are currently the best way to experience it, aside from the hobbled multiplayer matchmaking.",1
"610","It’s as much a masterpiece on PS4 as it is on PS3, and it’s worth your undivided attention whether you’ve played it already or are about to jump in for the first time.",1
"611","Nearly every aspect of Smash Wii U seems fine-tuned not only to appeal to the nostalgia of long-time Nintendo fans, but also to be accessible to new players. Once they’re hooked, it draws them in deeper with a set of great modes and tempting rewards.",1
"612","This sequel builds on everything that made the original great, and delivers one of the most satisfying action games I've played.",1
"613","That sense of creative progression, coupled with the inherent danger of exploring underground caverns full of monsters, makes Minecraft exciting, rewarding, tense, and one of gaming’s most expressive creative outlets.",1
"614","Reshaping a pristine landscape into new world using your own two hands while things try to kill you isn’t just an amazingly rewarding gaming experience, it’s a clever retelling of human history.",1
"615","An absolute joy of an adventure. It’s filled with unforgettable characters, incredible puzzles, and one of the most gorgeous worlds you’ll find in games. It culminates with an effective cliffhanger that has me counting the days until I can finish Vella and Shay’s adventure in Act 2.",1
"616","Episode 2 is one of the best Telltale has ever made. It’s big, full of great dialogue, devastating consequences, memorable and fun action scenes, and places a smart, scary plot at center stage.",1
"617","This is perhaps the most heartbreaking and tense episode of anything Telltale has ever made. How Clementine braces for the impact of everything in front of her is up to you -- and where that takes her left me in awe.",1
"618","It’s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way, but it’s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope, and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem...It is one of the very best video games ever made.",1
"619","Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain is a gameplay marvel, rewarding intelligence and creativity in a way few games do.",1
"620","There have certainly been sandbox action games that have given me a bigger world to roam, or more little icons to chase on my minimap, but none have pushed me to plan, adapt, and improvise the way this one does. Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain doesn’t just respect my intelligence as a player, it expects it of me, putting it in league that few others occupy.",1
"621","It's hard to express just how much I adore Undertale without spoiling anything significant, but that's what I love about it. It tells its story in such a dynamic way, and with such a great understanding of the RPG player’s mindset, that it couldn’t have been told in any other way. It's a masterfully crafted experience that I won't forget any time soon.",1
"622","Even the technical shakiness that crops up here and there can’t even begin to slow down its momentum.",1
"623","Hand on heart, I can’t remember ever being so consistently thrilled, surprised and delighted by a football game before.",1
"624","Great new reasons to obsessively gather and hoard relics of happier times, strong companions, and sympathetic villains driving tough decisions make it an adventure I’ll definitely replay and revisit. Even the technical shakiness that crops up here and there can’t even begin to slow down its momentum.",1
"625","The world, exploration, crafting, atmosphere, and story of Fallout 4 are all key parts of this hugely successful sandbox role-playing game. Great new reasons to obsessively gather and hoard relics of happier times, strong companions, and sympathetic villains driving tough decisions make it an adventure I’ll definitely replay and revisit",1
"626","Inside very clearly builds upon what made Limbo great, and in fact builds something greater. Its unimaginable twist may leave you dumbfounded, confused, and quite possibly speechless, but it will fuel heated discussion with your friends about its meaning, its message, and its intentions.",1
"627","Forza Horizon 3 is a masterclass in open-world racing and bigger and better than its excellent predecessor across the board. It looks fantastic, the car selection and customisation is second to none, and the size and variety of the sprawling Australian outback is magnificent. Above all, Horizon 3 never loses sight of the fact that tearing through postcard-perfect locations should be fun, and it puts the tools in our hands to keep it that way, always. This is the racing game I’ve been waiting for, and it's officially my favourite thing on four wheels. A fair dinkum triumph, mates.",1

"629","If Dark Souls 3 truly is the last in the series as we know it, then it’s a worthy send-off. Weapon arts allow stylish and versatile new moves without tarnishing the purity of the combat system. Lothric’s awe-inspiring locations provide visually stunning arenas for rigorous exploration and fierce face-offs with hosts of deadly enemies and even deadlier bosses. While not all the risky changes land as neatly as others, Dark Souls 3 is a powerful journey and the sequel the series truly deserves.",1

"631","Fire Emblem: Revelation is an excellent final act to the Fates storyline. Its balance of difficulty and accessibility means that both veteran players and newcomers can enjoy it without feeling bored or overwhelmed, and its story starts slowly, but quickly becomes a worthy finale to this tactical trilogy.",1
"632","For the most part, its themes weave themselves beautifully throughout the gorgeous world and wide variety of puzzles, but even when it breaks subtlety in favor of a more heavy-handed approach to exposition, it never detracts from the truly fulfilling moments The Witness offers in terms of solving its physical puzzles and unlocking its deepest mysteries.",1
"633","The Witness is a game brimming with secrets: daunting and multilayered mysteries that sunk into my subconscious, tracing snaking paths across my brain until I was literally seeing mazes every time I closed my eyes. That’s the kind of power The Witness has. It hooked me in with its masterful puzzle design and gorgeous visuals, then compelled me forward as I began to carve out my own purpose on the island. It’s a freedom granted by a world as welcomingly open to exploration as it is enjoyably challenging to crack open.",1
"634","The intense difficulty is squarely aimed at veteran Fire Emblem players, and its satisfying campaign is full of variety and challenge. And even though a win or loss can down to sheer luck, I walked away either satisfied or eager to give it another shot.",1
"635","With smarter AI opposition and an altogether smoother online experience, PES 2017 is close to the complete package. FIFA’s new story mode might be the most headline-grabbing feature of either game this year, but it’s clear Konami is in no mood to relinquish its title as king of the virtual pitch.",1
"636","I feel like I’ve touched upon everything I love about Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir, and yet I still can’t seem to say enough good things about this amazing remake.",1
"637","It’s a short ride, but one I felt compelled to take again – including a search for its mysterious hidden orb collectibles. Play it soon before anyone spoils a single big moment for you.",1
"638","The Witness has a power and pull that carried me throughout the more than 40 hours it took to complete it for the first time, and that, even now, beckons me back to confront the mysteries I left unsolved. Its graceful combination of tangible goals, obscurity, and freedom creates ample opportunity for small victories and grand revelations alike.",1

"640","The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a masterclass in open-world design and a watershed game that reinvents a 30-year-old franchise. It presents a wonderful sandbox full of mystery, dangling dozens upon dozens of tantalizing things in front of you that just beg to be explored. I’ve had so many adventures in Breath of the Wild, and each one has a unique story behind what led me to them, making them stories on top of stories. And even after I’ve spent more than 50 hours searching the far reaches of Hyrule, I still manage to come across things I haven’t seen before. I’ll easily spend 50 to 100 more trying to track down its fascinating moments.",1
"641","Mario’s games have been around for almost as long as game consoles have been a thing, but thankfully, he’s always evolving. We rarely get the same Mario twice. Super Mario Odyssey delivers on that ongoing promise of originality and innovation: It distills the venerable series’ joyful, irreverent world and characters and best-in-class platforming action, and introduces a steady stream of new and unexpected mechanics. It’s all spun together into a generational masterpiece.",1
"642","Divinity: Original Sin 2 may have been designed in the spirit of decades-old RPGs like Baldur’s Gate 2, but that legacy serves only as a foundation for the expansive game Larian has built on top of it. Few other RPGs allow such a wide range of flexibility while also supporting rewarding combat and a powerful story, all in a world that feels alive in the ways it reacts to you and goes about its business without you. It's a rare RPG that I’ll want to play through again and again, driven by the feeling that so many fascinating and surprising paths remain undiscovered, some of which might lead to different outcomes for the NPCs I’ve grown to care about – even the rats. When that happens, you're experiencing something worth remembering, and Divinity: Original Sin 2 will be remembered as one of the greats.",1
"643","Persona 5 is a massive, gorgeous JRPG with well over 100 hours of gameplay for completionists. With more to do than ever and the series’ strongest story to date, it stands out as an extraordinary, memorable experience and easily one of the deepest JRPGs of the last decade. Its sprawling dungeon design and stylish, fully realized world are an absolute joy to explore, and even after three playthroughs and the Platinum trophy, I find myself itching to go back to try different dialogue options with Confidants or revisit particularly fun puzzles. This is a new gold standard for Japanese RPGs and by far the best entry in the series yet.",1
"644","After playing through Undertale on PS4, I’m happy to report that everything was ported over to console perfectly (including the clever takes on saved games and more)...It's a masterfully crafted experience that I won't forget any time soon.",1
"645","Nioh could well take over 100 hours if you set out to master its many side missions on top of its tough campaign, but it’s a challenge well worth taking. The way it builds on its most obvious inspirations with a highly refined combat system and an unexpectedly charming, yet gritty style all its own allows it to boldly carve out its own identity, standing as a shining example of what action RPGs can be.",1
"646","The Nintendo Switch version provides an authentic Minecraft experience that is hugely benefitted by the ability to play it anywhere with physical controls. The one drawback is the lack of voice chat, which makes online multiplayer less fun than on other platforms, so it’s best enjoyed in the same room as your friends.",1
"647","PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds has taken the military-sim gameplay popularized by games like ARMA and DayZ, boiled it down to its most exciting parts, and streamlined it into quick and accessible rounds of pure, hassle-free, survival-based action. Even though each game starts the same way, its remarkable ability to feel like a new, tense adventure each and every round has kept me coming back for hours on end.",1
"648","MLB The Show 17 builds on last year’s version, which many cited as the best in the series, by adding some key features and improvements. Most notable are increased hit variety, MLB Network integration, and the RTTS documentary. All of these additions make the game feel more like real baseball. This authenticity makes games more fun to play, as it’s easier than ever to become invested in every pitch.",1
"649","It’s an epic journey that made me feel thrilled, devastated, and awed, and its tense moments had me tugging my collar both in and out of its fast-paced mystical sports arenas. With an emotionally charged ending that saw so much I’d striven for come to fruition, but was still tinged with tragedy and melancholy even when I did almost everything right, I won’t be able to get Pyre out of my head for a long time. This is Supergiant’s best work to date, and that’s saying something.",1
"650","From the art to the music to the story to the tactical gameplay, and even to how they’re all woven together so artfully, Pyre is an adventure that excels in every area of its design other than limiting its multiplayer to local only.",1
"651","Tekken 7 truly is a hallmark, a fighting game crafted with obvious affection. It strikes a fine balance between accessibility to series newcomers and retaining much of its technical traditions. The soundtrack is an electronic treat, and while the story can at times seem a bit cliche, the fact that it never takes itself too seriously lets it bring in a tremendous amount of flexible character customization. Its dedication to the details helps push it into the position of my favorite fighting game of 2017 so far.",1

"653","Mastering Fortnite Battle Royale’s many systems is worth every second of investment. Whether you go it alone or queue up with a squad, even if you’re the first to die or you actually manage to earn the Victory Royale, Fortnite’s zany style and unique blend of shooting and building almost never offers anything less than an outstanding time. It may not be the first battle royale game, and it certainly won’t be the last, but Fortnite sets itself apart from the crowd by giving you the freedom and tools to express your own personal playstyle.",1
"654","Red Dead Redemption 2 stands shoulder-to-shoulder with Grand Theft Auto V as one of the greatest games of the modern age. It’s a gorgeous depiction of an ugly period that’s patient, polished, and a huge amount of fun to play, and it’s combined with Rockstar’s best storytelling to date.",1
"655","Red Dead Redemption 2 is a game of rare quality; a meticulously polished open world ode to the outlaw era.",1
"656","I expected great action from God of War, and it delivers that handily. But I didn’t expect it to be a thrilling journey in which every aspect of it complements the others to form what is nothing short of a masterpiece. It’s a game in which Kratos, a previously one-note character, becomes a complex father, warrior, and monster, embattled both on the field and within his own heart about how to treat his son; one in which the world opens up and shifts, offering rewards in both gameplay and knowledge of its lore that I treasured with each accomplishment. The obvious care that went into crafting its world, characters, and gameplay delivers by far the most stirring and memorable game in the series.",1
"657","The greatest triumph of Celeste is that its best-in-class jumping and dashing is blended beautifully with an important and sincere story and an incredible soundtrack that make it a genuinely emotional game, even when your feet are planted firmly on the ground.",1
"658","I’ll always have a massive soft spot for the down under delights of Forza Horizon 3, but open-world racing has never looked as good as it does in Forza Horizon 4. It combines a beautiful world that’s really four hugely distinct maps in one with a constantly rewarding and self-renewing racing experience and I really can’t tear myself away from it. Playground Games hasn’t just upped the ante once again; it’s blown the bloody doors off.",1

"662","Inside very clearly builds upon what made Limbo great, and in fact builds something greater. Its unimaginable twist may leave you dumbfounded, confused, and quite possibly speechless, but it will fuel heated discussion with your friends about its meaning, its message, and its intentions. It’s a short ride, but one I felt compelled to take again – including a search for its mysterious hidden orb collectibles. Play it soon before anyone spoils a single big moment for you.",1
"663","Dead Cells is rewarding in its flexibility in a way few games are. Each easily digestible run through its beautifully detailed and shifting levels instills a feeling of discovery and familiarity. It goads you to push the limits of your ability, and mercilessly crushes you when you get too comfortable. There are layers of strategy and tactics buried not only in the immediate choices you make, but in the grander metagame each run builds toward.",1
"664","The true definition of a classic, the gameplay and story of Shadow of the Colossus are every bit as great and emotional today as they were in 2005. This outstanding remaster skillfully enhances those qualities with improved controls, performance, and sheer graphical beauty. It remains one of the best PlayStation games ever made, and it’s wonderful that Sony has brought it back to the fore so a new generation of gamers can experience it without having to look past its aged facade.",1

"666","This is the most audacious Monster Hunter game yet. Monster Hunter: World manages the balance between staying true to the series’ ideals and the addictive loop of combat with intimidating monsters and meaningful upgrades that fans love, while also taking a dramatic leap into a look, feel, and size that feels truly new. Its sheer depth and the commitment required is still intense, but it clearly isn’t Capcom's aim to court a casual crowd. It’s as all-consuming and incredible a ride as ever.",1

"669","Fitting for the series’ first ever western PC version, this isn’t a case of bringing flashy new exclusive content but a supremely stable, confidently-put-together package of what got all the console players so excited about in January. If it’s the first time you’ve gotten a chance to see what Monster Hunter is all about, this is as good a starting point as you’re likely to get.",1

"672","Dark Souls Remastered is a technically better version of an already-exceptional game. While the Switch version may lack some of the higher-end features available on other platforms, it still presents a more pristine version of the original, and importantly adds the exciting and absorbing dimension to explore Lordran on a portable device.",1

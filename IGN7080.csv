"1","Despite the disappointing multiplayer options, the clichéd characters, and the sometimes repetitious nature of the campaign, the strategy gameplay of Shadow Wars is fun enough to make it a worthy recommendation for any turn-based enthusiast.",0
"2","The[] ability to tear apart and repair the environments at will is a hook that keeps working, and when the campaign gives you plenty of stuff to tear apart it's easy to lose yourself to a primal need to destroy.",0
"3","It's funny, it clever, and it answers a lot of questions I had. I enjoyed playing it, but I didn't love it. The story isn't as grounded as I'd like it to be at certain points, so it throws the balance of sincere/goofy off. I wanted the conclusion of the serious movie feelings episode one started, but I got the comical ending of a Saturday morning cartoon.",0
"4","Through questionable level design, graphical inconsistency, and repetitive gameplay, I was pulled out of the experience more than I would have liked. Alice: Madness Returns is a memorable peek through a flawed looking glass.",0
"5","With a level-headed team of four, Magicka's cooperative action is entrancing chaos. It's rare for a game to feel this mechanically satisfying.",0
"6","Serious Sam 3: BFE will ultimately exhaust its players by virtue of its screen-filling mega-confrontations, its non-stop repetition and the sense that you are almost always mercilessly outgunned. Sam 3 is good but could have been better.",0
"7","DCUO is far from a bad game; there are indeed times when it shines fantastically with the potential for greatness, but its many faults, most minor but some quite large, ensure that it never reaches those heights.",0
"8","A dungeon crawler with a boring loot table, poorly implemented multiplayer, and little lasting incentive to continue running around the world once the tedious story ends.",0
"9","There's something kind of addictive about teaching your fake dog new tricks. For repeat customers, unless your kid is still playing the first game religiously, I don't see the upgraded version holding their interest for nearly as long.",0
"10","There's something kind of addictive about teaching your fake dog new tricks. For repeat customers, unless your kid is still playing the first game religiously, I don't see the upgraded version holding their interest for nearly as long.",0
"11","There's something kind of addictive about teaching your fake dog new tricks. For repeat customers, unless your kid is still playing the first game religiously, I don't see the upgraded version holding their interest for nearly as long.",0
"12","It's just disappointing that the developers only added a handful of mostly inconsequential extra modes in the interim, and didn't take that extra time available to fix a few of the first versions' flaws.",0
"13","For its effective use of 3D gameplay and its simple yet refined design, PilotWings deserves a good deal of credit.",0
"14","There's a lot of talking and gathering things for other people. It's rather ho-hum.",0
"15","Caught somewhere between massively-multiplayer online role-playing game and hardcore competitive real-time strategy, Age of Empires Online delivers some of the most addictive parts of both. Some sloppy mechanics and balance and reward issues detract from the core Age of Empires experience, but not to the point that it's not worth playing.",0
"16","The lack of feedback, in-game competition, and unpredictability hurt the game's long-term draw; some older business simulations didn't have these problems. Cities in Motion does feature stellar tools and is one of the prettier business simulations on the market.",0
"17","An online shooter needs variety, depth, and addictiveness to succeed over the long term. Brink might find a niche with some hardcore fans, but it isn't for everyone. The PC version feels more complete than its console counterpart, but my qualms over content remain the same. Brink has heart, but the overall package is lacking.",0
"18","The majority of the new features introduced in The Sims 3: Generations are enjoyable enough to fiddle with, but none of them are major game changers.",0
"19","The content of Dead Money can get frustrating quickly. Still, for the patient souls out there, this fresh spin on Fallout is a decent buy.",0
"20","Sequence is sort of like serving someone a ham sandwich on a silver tray with all sorts of accoutrements. It's nice that it's a silver tray and not a paper plate, but I'm still eating a ham sandwich here.",0
"21","Homefront is certainly one of the most unique shooters I've ever played, driven by an ingenious and surprisingly well-fleshed out plot and a dark and dreary, realistic setting. But it also controls and feels like a typical shooter, looks like a game that's several years old, and most importantly, has an inexcusably brief campaign.",0
"22","Q.U.B.E. offers some short-term fun for puzzle fans and not a lot else. With so little emphasis put on story I can't help but feel that Q.U.B.E. may have benefitted from having no story elements at all, instead of loosely hinting at some bigger picture that goes unseen.",0
"23","Delivers an interesting and fun variation of a traditional card game and turns it into a competitive puzzle with myriad nuances to its strategy. Unfortunately, it doesn't do enough to keep the variation fresh throughout.",0
"24","It's far from a perfect game -- inconsistent AI, a campaign that borders on the short side, and limited multiplayer options certainly hamper the experience -- but there's a lot of challenging satisfaction to be found beneath the thick jungle canopy.",0
"25","The flawed story mode can be safely passed by, but if you're able to find an opponent online or skirmish against the AI it's easier to appreciate Oil Rush's strengths.",0
"26","A surprisingly rich title for a handheld console. It's perfect for a quick game on tiresome commutes.",0
"27","Whereas the console version of Sonic Generations is a blending of old and new mentality in a fast-paced speed fest, the 3DS version is mostly just a Sonic Rush game where both playable characters happen to be Sonic.",0
"28","While it's admirable that the team had opted to create an original story set alongside the events in the books, you'll wish that they had attempted to take more risks with the project. The characters are bland and lifeless, and the combat, while fun at first, gets pretty repetitive before too long.",0
"29","It's like an interactive coloring book made by a 10 year old obsessed with Mastodon.",0
"30","A fun but deceptively shallow Sim-RPG-thing that would have benefitted from pushing the envelope for either genre a little more.",0
"31","The vast amount of customization options and the simple but fun battle system kept me interested enough to overlook the poor execution of story.",0
"32","Despite its considerable flaws, at its core, Mercenaries is a ton of fun. From the moment I started playing it I couldn't put it down.",0
"33","Sure, it's not very deep from an RPG-elements perspective, nor does it have the kind of story that's going to make you go ""Hm!"", but it will entertain you and help whet your appetite for the monster-stomping extravaganza that will be Serious Sam 3.",0
"34","Purchasing Arrival means there's more to do in Mass Effect 2, and that's always a good thing. It sets up the tone of urgency that's prevalent in the Mass Effect 3 trailer, but don't expect it to explain a lot. If you don't mind combat-focused, linear missions, it's worth the $7.",0
"35","F1 experts have probably already been racing their way through the home console versions of this title since September. With the 3DS version's odd A.I., it's hard to recommend that Formula fans give this edition a go. Codemasters knows racing -- but when they pass off portable development to other teams, you've got to be wary.",0
"36","The massive character customization also makes your faery or elf feel unique, so if you enjoy leveling up and finding loot, you should check out Faery: Legends of Avalon.",0
"37","Well executed, but lacking in depth (which is ironic for a multitude of reasons). However, once you give it a fair shot, you'll be surprised how addictive the gameplay is and how much fun you'll have trying to master the controls and conquer each mission.",0
"38","If simple fun and the inclusion of Pokemon is all you're looking for, then Rumble Blast is the game for you. Otherwise, there are much more deserving 3DS titles to spend your hard-earned cash on.",0
"39","Despite its many shortcomings, Splinter Cell 3D is still fun to play. And that's what matters most. It's not even close to being as good as Chaos Theory on Xbox, but then again, I couldn't play that on a plane. If the AI were even passable and not laughable, this would be an easier recommendation.",0
"40","For us, it's all about the sweet science, and in this regard SFxT is still sorely lacking.",0
"41","Something of an uncanny experience. A lot of the experience remains intact but its vitality has been drained away. It's a muted affair, and that ultimately harms a game that derives so much of its charm from those little touches.",0
"42","It's good, chaotic fun and has a baseline level of quality and polish that's pleasing to see. If this is your first Wipeout game, chances are you'll have a blast. For veterans, however – especially those schooled in the delights of HD and Fury – this game just isn't as smooth in feel or as elegant in design.",0
"43","Little Inferno looks nice, tells a unique story and will perhaps be seen by some as a triumph in experimental design. But it's not really a video game, so feel free to forget this freaky fireplace.",0
"44","Tera's an action-MMO that nails the ""action"" part and then manages a face-palm-inducing face-plant on all the other bits.",0
"45","There's still plenty of life in the genre, as this creative romp amply demonstrates, even if fully appreciating it takes more patience than some will be able to muster.",0
"46","Has a nice, colorful approach to golf and a respectable set of multiplayer options. But the disconnect between the amount of time required to plan a shot and the milliseconds needed to mess it all up sparks ample frustrations.",0
"47","It's impressive that Namco-Bandai has managed to port a full-sized, voice-acted Japanese RPG to the 3DS without sacrificing any of the content from the PlayStation 2 version. But it's also a six-year-old game that hasn't aged well in all respects, and if you're a North American Tales fan, it's likely to be one you've played before.",0
"48","It's hard to deny the value of buying a pool game on Vita and getting its PlayStation 3 counterpart as an added bonus. And graphically, Hustle Kings looks really nice. So despite the odd musical choices, spooky floating cue, bad connectivity, and annoying precision camera, Hustle Kings is still a good game.",0
"49","In light of its technical flaws, we'd only cautiously recommend buying it on Vita. If you own a PS3, Xbox 360 or Wii U, you'd be better off with any of those versions, while those seeking a fast-paced racer that really makes their Vita sing should consider WipEout 2048 ahead of this.",0
"50","More variety in the graphics and gameplay modes would have helped, but for those who want to listen to music on a long flight, for example, Symphony provides an excellent way to enhance that experience and get a little gaming satisfaction on the way.",0
"51","The Secret World flirts with brilliance and – at least, during earlier zones – looks primed to seal the deal. But, as time goes on, its its seemingly bottomless bag of tricks starts to look a bit shallow.",0
"52","The real strength of When Vikings Attack is its humor. It doesn't take itself seriously, and provides a nice change of pace from the deluge of first-person shooters and bloody action games we're all becoming more accustomed to. But its gameplay won't hook you for more than a passing few hours.",0
"53","The idea of rotating orbits and fantastic aesthetics make Unstoppable Gorg feel striking and unique to start, but the rest of the game doesn't live up to that great first impression.",0
"54","War of the Roses isn't quite Mount and Blade or Battlefield, but it manages to walk a fine line between the two models to produce an innovative and enjoyable experience.",0
"55","The interplay between Horatio and Crispin as they push deeper into this pixelated robotic realm to recover their stolen goods is a high point in an adventure that feels like a bit of a slog despite its relatively short length.",0
"56","A fine game that Mega Man fans will enjoy once or twice, but one without that special something that would allow it to rise to the greatness Mega Man so regularly reached in its heyday.",0
"57","The moves and kills you'd expect are here, but the story is boiled down to be easy to jump in and out of. That takes away some of the excitement in playing through it.",0
"58","The game never embraces its Mario heritage, never allowing itself to break out of a more typical tennis mold to be something unique.",0
"59","It's Piranha Bytes' most accessible game yet, and though its style and boorish, humorous dialogue fit well with the pirate motif, it's a role-playing experience that uses convention as a crutch and marginalizes or strips away a lot of elements that made the studio's past games stand out.",0
"60","It's more of a short-term investment than some might be expecting, then, but while you're caught in its irresistible loot cycle, you'll probably find it very hard to put down.",0
"61","If you're at all interested in the interactive fiction genre, knowing full well that there's not a whole lot of actual interaction, that's an eminently fair price.",0
"62","Shad'O may not offer much in the way of new gameplay mechanics over the countless other tower defense games already available, but it distinguishes itself through its striking art design and compelling narrative.",0
"63","Beyond the winning localization and expert voice acting, though, playing through this adventure just felt lacking – its various unique ideas and innovations never came together to create a real sense of fun.",0
"64","Although it suffers from some inconsistent AI, spotty online matchmaking and some balancing problems created by Golden Abyss-centric augments, it's still hard to deny that Uncharted: Fight For Fortune is a fun game.",0
"65","While it has some great mini-games, it forcefully limits itself and discards many of the ideas that made its predecessors so good.",0
"66","F1 2011 isn't quite up to the excellent standard of the console version, but it's still far, far better than the 3DS instalment.",0
"67","With more maps, classes, the ability to server browse and customization options promised there's a lot of potential in Forge, but what you're buying now feels like a beta with a great foundation.",0
"68","A functional shooter with a sense of humor and a Batman license. It's got plenty to unlock, but it's not all that deep. Go, shoot, win. Over and over. If you're looking for a first-person shooter that doesn't take itself seriously, have at it, but don't expect a FPS revolution.",0
"69","The combination of the excellent community, unwavering focus on running the business, and the simplicity of the controls and your responsibilities creates a unique business simulation that rewards you proportionally to the amount of work you put into it.",0
"70","None of its individual parts is particularly original, but put together in the way they have been, you end up with a synergistic success of a puzzle title that will test both reflexes and noggin-scratching abilities.",0
"71","Though 2 Dawn did an admirable job of blending accessible vehicle-based combat with a few instances of more sophisticated mechanics, it feels like the game could have used more development time to smooth out the technical issues and, ideally, add in more weapons and combat options.",0
"72","Warriors Orochi 3 Hyper, while damaged in the shift from the other HD systems to the Wii U, ends up maintaining its appeal as one of this series' best installments.",0
"73","Despite its visual beauty and impressive execution, limited gameplay and general bugginess hold everything back. This beast has room to grow. When it does, expect great things. For now, a little turbulence makes for a bumpy ride.",0
"74","If you're a football obsessive or a stickler for the real thing, UEFA Euro 2012 is probably worth grafting onto your existing copy of FIFA 12. But for many, the same experience can easily be approximated by playing the game they already own with a through-ball from their imagination.",0
"75","Breathtaking to behold and controls beautifully, with well-designed levels and fun platforming. It's really too bad the experience is hampered by its unacceptably short length, as well as by the fact that the painting mechanic gets repetitive.",0
"76","If you haven't played FreakyForms before, this is probably the version to get, though the few improvements aren't enough to make the extra investment worthwhile for those who already own the downloadable version.",0
"77","The menus bury the coolest stuff, the touch controls are peculiarly particular, and even though the Vita is a connected device, I feel alone when I play this. If you're looking for a bright and colorful kart racer with good mechanics, ModNation Racers: Road Trip fits the bill, but it doesn't excel anywhere else.",0
"78","Like the other Michael Jackson games, Vita's first rhythm game suffers from a short setlist and only one real mode of play. It's a shame the experience ends in a tragic few hours, as dancing with your fingertips offers a special sort of enjoyment fitting for the King of Pop's best tracks.",0
"79","Army Corps of Hell has a great premise, some intense boss fights, and a fantastic soundtrack. Unfortunately, the repetitious gameplay bogs the experience down, making this a trip to hell that you're not going to want to keep returning to.",0
"80","A generally good experience, and a fun one most of the time, but its issues keep it from truly ascending to the heights of being Spectacular. Or Sensational. Or Astonishing.",0
"81","The issues themselves are a little more engaging than before, but the departure of quirky campaigns and beloved former presidents like Abraham Lincoln and JFK pose significant threats to its replayability. Without them, The Political Machine 2012 is a sober reminder of the problem that's plagued American politics almost since the beginning: at heart, it's still just the same old game.",0
"82","Its appeal is shortened by the ludicrous speed at which we can zip across it and grow tired of its lack of challenge.",0
"83","With strong visuals and convincing audio backing it up, I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent inside my P-36 Hawk, and its generous free-to-play model never got in the way.",0
"84","Dual Destinies won’t change anybody’s minds about the series’ brand of narrative-heavy, gameplay-light adventuring, but longtime fans will be thrilled by the full docket of goofy legal twists and turns and fun characters.",0
"85","While I appreciate the world, atmosphere, and mechanics, I can't help but wish that there was a light at the end of Don't Starve's dark and lonely tunnel.",0
"86","The default game mode of Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move is little more than a Nintendo-themed reskin of the 25-year-old Pipe Mania, and frustrates with its randomness. The much better Puzzle Palace and Many Mini Mayhem modes, thankfully, leave us with a good game overall.",0
"87","It’s amazingly inventive and full of color and bright-eyed character, but its control problems are so persistent they’re unignorable.",0
"88","Its smaller levels, restrictive time limit, and floaty physics work well as a challenge mode add-on to an already terrific game. But as fun as it often is, this still feels more like an addendum to NSMBU – a remix, rather than something new that stands on its own.",0
"89","The bite-sized scope and limited choices available make me more interested to see what Shadowrun Returns will be a year from now, after the community has used the included mod tools to build on it, than in what it is today.",0
"90","In terms of story, dialogue, and encounter design, this add-on pales in comparison to the rest of Borderlands 2.",0
"91","Reus is a gorgeous-looking, imaginative game which suffers from over-baked mechanics, but those hungry for to play god are still likely to find one of their favourite Populous-style games in a long while.",0
"92","Arma III’s complexity is a double-edged sword. It takes a long time to comprehend, but once you’re comfortable enough with its mechanics to take advantage of them under pressure, you’re able to engage in a kind of large-scale tactical combat that’s simply not offered elsewhere.",0
"93","Neverwinter isn't a hardcore MMORPG, nor is it likely to compel you to cast aside your current favorite MMO to devote your full attention to it. But taken in small doses, it's a generally fun and free romp through one of fantasy's most beloved universes.",0
"94","The matchmaking system is straight-up broken, leading to frequent frustrating mismatches, and its four maps aren’t enough to keep me around for long.",0
"95","Miraculously miniscule price tag or not, Van Helsing is a damn (and probably damned) solid game.",0
"96","For better or worse, Freedom Cry feels like an entire Assassin's Creed game distilled into five hours. That’s good, but it’s an Assassin’s Creed game that doesn’t include many of the steps forward that Black Flag so recently made.",0
"97","Ikachan is disturbingly short, but the winning game design and charm might make the $4.99 download worth your time, especially if you’re a fan of Cave Story or Nicalis’ other work.",0
"98","Digital Extremes has created something that's often genuinely fun to play, and given the cost of entry, Warframe's well worth a try if you're in the mood for something different.",0
"99","Its slant on side quests and completionism did, at first, scratch an itch for me, but Doki soon suffers from its sheer repetition, especially because it lacks any sort of tangible challenge. Doki-Doki Universe began to stumble from exceptional to acceptable as the hours wore on.",0
"100","Played with a mouse and keyboard Spartan Assault becomes a much more enjoyable experience, better able to recreate classic moments of Halo brilliance, but it’s still limited by hit-and-miss mission design and fiction that takes the urgency out of this fight for survival.",0
"101","Though Burial at Sea Episode 1 may be a short vignette next to Infinite’s novel, it’s still one you aren’t likely to put down for the brief time it lasts -- and it’s priced accordingly at $15.",0
"102","A solid game, but one that feels like a testbed for something much better - once the designers have the guts to fully chart a new path instead of relying on tried and Aperture Science-tested concepts we’ve all already seen played out.",0
"103","Retrovirus successfully updates the little-used concept of 3D six-axis combat known best from Descent for contemporary audiences, but it suffers from insane difficulty spikes, a tendency toward repetition and a disjointed story.",0
"104","In the burgeoning sub-genre of physics-based, liquid platformers, Puddle is a game that only hits a little more than it misses.",0
"105","Thunder Wolves isn’t so much a wolf as a one-trick pony. And while that one trick – frantic, adrenaline-pumping action served with a healthy dose macho humor and feel-good firepower – is an exceptionally fun trick, it doesn't last long.",0
"106","Once you get the hang of it all, the strategic combat and its required pre-game build strategy and in-game adaptivity is fun, but don’t expect to master its tricky team-based combat and overwhelming upgrade system without a serious commitment.",0
"107","The Last Ranger comes up short as a sequel, as it spends too much time retreading the same territory we saw in the first game and addresses none of its flaws.",0
"108","A fun but short addition to the franchise. It's an acceptable substitute to the console experience, mostly on the strength of its interesting villain and original story. Just don't expect to get as much content out of this one as you'd get on the consoles.",0
"109","Despite the intriguing fighting-game veneer, the mechanics underneath are very standard, and there’s not much else here to compensate for that fact.",0
"110","The Jak and Daxter Collection’s three games are excellent, but if you have the ability to play them on the PS3 (or hell, even the PS2), then that's the way to go.",0
"111","As a game about family relationships The Novelist is interesting and relatable up to a point, but it doesn’t have a great deal of emotional depth, and the further you get into it the more you notice the flaws in its characterisation. Despite that, though, it’s worth a few hours of your time.",0
"112","Slender: The Arrival manages to deliver some truly impressive scares, but you’ll have to wade through the muck of repetitive tasks and unfair enemies in order to experience them. I found more enjoyment in playing the free original installment, which delivers a powerful horror experience without the annoyances and filler.",0
"113","A Murder of Ravens saves The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief from going down in flames, but its narrative repetition and technical defects make for a turbulent ride.",0
"114","Powerstar Golf manages to successfully marry an old-school arcade golf experience with some decidedly new-school ideas. The lack of proper online multiplayer is a bit of a blow, but the Rivals mode has the potential to provide an ongoing challenge after you’ve scooped up all of the career medals.",0
"115","In some ways I'd equate SimCity to an early version of Minecraft: a wonderfully creative toy attached to a barely functional game.",0
"116","At its best, it presents a gleefully cutthroat philosophy of human interaction, pushing you to be as terrible as possible within a charming cartoonish parody. It doesn't always manage to hold onto that feeling, but Redshirt has enough unique personality to endure.",0
"117","It's an eclectic mixture of imagination, interpretation, and (purposefully constrained) interaction that really doesn't work as often as it should, but – on the rare occasions when all the pieces fit together – it creates some heart-fluttering highs.",0
"118","Batman: Arkham Origins - Blackgate is a good extension of the Arkham franchise to handhelds, but it lacks the specialness or inspiration that would make it stand out as a great Metroidvania-style game - or a great Batman game, for that matter. Without any real surprises, engaging settings, or interesting story, Blackgate feels more like a retread of bullet points than the handheld Batman we truly deserve.",0
"119","Rather than fix the graphics and the performance problems that plagued the original two years ago, Techland slightly modified the setting and delivered a new character and more content. It’s a fun time, but there are no surprises or killer new features to make it an impressive package.",0
"120","Ryse has an entertaining story and sky-high production values. The gameplay that’s there isn’t bad – it just stops in its tracks before it gets anywhere near close to demanding.",0
"121","Sonic’s sensation of speed is mostly intact and most stages look impressive, but Sonic: Lost World stumbles due to poor level design.",0
"122","If you keep in mind that this is a budget release when setting expectations of how many maps, guns, and customization options it should contain, there’s plenty of fast-paced action to be had gunning all the way through Hades – one weeping classicist at a time.",0
"123","Some of the most disappointing games to play are those that have brilliant ideas, and even pull a few of them off, but can’t maintain quality across the board. Horizon is an extreme example of that category, where a quarter of it is some of the cleverest design turn-based space strategy has seen in years, half of it is fine, and the last quarter is virtually unplayable.",0
"124","The main problem with Space Hulk, though, is that its designers couldn't let it deviate from or build on the simple rules of a board game experience that lacks tactical depth.",0
"125","Save for a few puzzles that lose luster due to unintuitive and touchy physics, I mostly enjoyed testing both my platforming timing and my problem-solving skills with Kalimba's brain-busters.",0
"126","Elite: Dangerous is a beautiful game and an amazing space sim let down by a universe devoid of character and low on excitement.",0
"127","I have no doubt that the strength of the tactical combat will help find a strong niche, but for me, that just makes the relative weakness of the strategic side of gameplay all the more disappointing.",0
"128","It’s Adventure mode is beautifully designed, and new power-ups and character abilities switch up the usual bread-and-butter platforming gameplay, but it’s let down by limited options for co-operative play and most significantly, a number of game-breaking bugs on the PlayStation 4.",0
"129","Balance issues and multiplayer bugs remain, but there's enough variety found in its tower defense scenarios and three classes to warrant donning the legendary monster hunter's hat either again or for the very first time.",0
"130","It’s slightly off-putting that it definitely takes too long to get to the higher levels, and consequently that it strays close to undermining that desire to instantly have “just one more go.” The overall quality of the matching experience was ultimately strong enough to pull me back, largely helped by the smart secondary Puzzle Mode.",0
"131","D4 is an intriguing experience, and brimming with personality. It’s also the most polished game from Access to date, with a genuinely first-rate presentation.",0
"132","It’s mostly the moments in between battles that bring the whole experience down, as a lack of information and poor menus tarnish this flying ace.",0
"133","Character customization adds unique flavor to the simple combat, and the satisfying weapons, rewards, and story make it a fun alternative to the typically serious Zelda games. It’s just a shame you can’t share the action with a friend without significant slowdown.",0
"134","It will probably hold my interest far longer than Tropico 4 did. But at the same time, it's rough edges are a continual annoyance. The larger issue is that while Tropico 5 definitely introduces some new challenges and ideas, it's still a dangerously simple city-builder.",0
"135","It starts out strong with dozens of hidden gags hidden among the scenery, but unfortunately it loses its momentum once minigames start to dominate its three-hour running time.",0
"136","Road Not Taken is a[n] interesting mix of ideas that make a strong first impression but don’t quite come together.",0
"137","For those of us weaned on old-school click-and-point adventures (or anyone who wants to experience Sierra On-Line’s glory days), there’s no question - this is a must-play. The rest of you may be fascinated by its anachronisms, but still be dazzled by its dramatic story and classic puzzles.",0
"138","Though it feels like it moves a step back in the series’ multiplayer potential, the hundreds of dance moves, great progression between difficulties, and the more realized Fitness mode pick up the slack.",0
"139","Scrolls delivers a well-executed digital marriage of a collectible card game and board game with the potential for deep strategic play in the way those parts work together.",0
"140","Wearing its Metroid influences like a badge of pride, Xeodrifter's 2D exploration is equal parts fun and frustrating.",0
"141","Delivers entertaining hack-and-slash combat centered on combos and spells, but its risk-based reward system seems slightly out of place in a world where its hero so easily achieves great power and defense and makes risk obsolete.",0
"142","I like Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham, but I don’t love it as much as I’ve loved previous games in the series.",0
"143","Judged on its own, Dreamfall Chapters - Book One: Reborn falls flat, and will confuse series newcomers.",0
"144","A noble attempt at creating a new kind of science-fiction strategy game that’s sadly weaker than the sum of its parts.",0
"145","The storytelling presumes you already know the source material by heart, which means things are sometimes a bit disjointed, and the game, like the movies it’s based on, ends at an awkward place. But like almost all the Lego games, this is a journey worth taking.",0
"146","Though Black deserves credit for adding new puzzle mechanics along the way, it could’ve easily seen its 6-8 hour runtime chopped in half and still gotten its message across.",0
"147","Its sharp wit and bevy of nerd-culture references offset the frustration that arises from an unrelentingly challenging dungeon crawler.",0
"148","Relatively simplistic compared to the N64-era shooters that inspired it, Screencheat nevertheless distinguishes itself with goofy charm, fast pacing, and a clever gameplay hook based on invisibility.",0
"149","Styx may stumble in its quicktime combat and its spotty edge detection, but it makes up for most of its flaws with challenging stealth action across massives levels.",0

"211","Episode 4: Metamorphosis does a satisfactory job at tying up Resident Evil Revelations 2’s mysteries, yet it also presents us with the clunkiest gameplay and dialogue we’ve seen in this series. While the bonus episodes and robust Raid mode extend the life of Revelations 2 beyond the credits, I wish it had gone out with a slightly bigger bang.",0
"212","One Piece’s unique style of fighting also translates quite well to musou combat, but fitting in the story bogs down that combat somewhat. Instead of enjoying both fighting and dialogue, it became a weird kind of chore to play through battles just to progress the story.",0

"214","While the story of these likable new characters continues after the shocking events of the premiere, the second episode makes it feel like a false start by neglecting to advance the plot in interesting ways.",0
"215","Episode 1 is let down by dull environments and creature design, but a terrific co-op mode, intriguing story, and replayable Raid Mode balances out its flaws. Not quite a headshot, then; but it’s left a bloody impression on me nonetheless.",0
"216","Hard West isn’t the deepest game of its kind, but it does a good job of walking the line between cold, hard tactics, and Weird West-style personality.",0
"217","As much as I enjoyed its aggressive brand of tactical combat and interesting enemy types, there are too many unpredictable variables outside your control, and too much happening to too many quickly aging, mortal characters for this tactical game to feel like decisions matter.",0
"218","Anno 2205 is an engaging and strategic city builder with unique challenges in each of its attractive biomes. But ultimately, it manifests as a never-ending treadmill of trying to supply the picky, luxury-loving consumers of the 23rd century with more techno-garbage.",0
"219","Lost Dimension is greatly held back by its inability to keep up the pressure of the disappointing betrayal system and its poorly written story. Still, this RPG manages to find its footing with its excellent combat system and interesting character abilities.",0
"220","It manages to maintain interest with randomized dungeons that usually work out well, but could really benefit from some balance tweaks and a way to put more fully developed decks to the test.",0
"221","Though it doesn’t always allow you to play it the way it seems to beg to be played, it still manages to be enjoyable overall until the credits roll.",0
"222","Quirks aside, Legends of Eisenwald is a strong, simple tactical RPG that’s all the better for staying within its means.",0
"223","The drama might not be as heightened as something like The Walking Dead, but I still found myself surprisingly invested in the choices I had to make about my companions, undeveloped as they may be, and smiling at the Minecrafty in-jokes.",0
"224","Gauntlet: Slayer Edition streamlines the combat and adds a bit more replay value to last year's release, but there still isn't quite enough meat on this dungeon crawler's bones.",0

"232","Chilling ghosts and a malevolent story make the new Fatal Frame an unsettling experience.",0

"234","While the first half of The Park tends to lean a bit too hard into the horror tropes of a spooky carnival, the final act does a really great job of developing a character with the pathos that comes from being a mother who’s having a tough time dealing with the impossible stress that comes from being a parent. Sure, it’s some of the same ground that Silent Hill games have covered in the past, but that doesn’t diminish its effectiveness.",0
"235","Customizing my own character’s equipment and move pool is fantastic...but it’s hard to get excited when combat feels hollow, especially for a franchise all about heroes stronger than Superman.",0
"236","It's supported by a few memorably silly cutscenes, but Gat Out of Hell isn't as story-rich or even as funny as previous Saints Row expansions, and so it ends up feeling like a missed opportunity, settling for a shallow diversion when it could have put a grand coda on Saints Row IV's story.",0
"237","Neverwinter's gamepad-friendly combat and intuitive interface make it the best fantasy MMORPG I’ve played on a console yet.",0
"238","In my experience, two types of people get the most enjoyment out of Mario Party: Small children and inebriated adults. Nintendo's intended audience in Mario Party 10, as with its predecessors, is clearly kids (they will probably love the amiibo tapping).",0
"239","Halo: Spartan Strike's upgraded parts aren't immediately apparent, but the sum total is pretty striking. A pinch of better aiming here, a heaping helping of Promethian enemies there, and annoying microtransactions nowhere make Spartan Strike worth the quick and cheap sub-ten-dollar tour.",0
"240","It charmed me with its blend of old-school RPG and contemporary satire, but nearly lost my vote with its sluggish pacing, irritatingly high enemy encounter rate, and crashes.",0
"241","Sid Meier’s Starships’ battles held my attention for a handful of games, after which point the tactical AI’s behavior became exploitable and the strategic layer became too muddled and unpredictable.",0
"242","Its best aspects are its stunning looks, atmosphere, and style – which are truly fantastic – and entertaining fiction. But the shallow, slow, and generic quick-time event-riddled gameplay make it feel like an experience that would've been better served by a non-interactive movie than a game.",0
"243","A lean tie-in that at least provides some great-looking new cars, a boost of nitrous, and a short but appropriately themed set of races. It’s fun while it lasts, but it’s also proved to be disappointingly built around recycled maps and events.",0
"244","A competent but completely uninspired physics puzzle game that owes much to its predecessors but never really builds on the concept with ideas of its own.",0
"245","Its clumsy controls make it disheartening at first, but it's worth it for the reward of eventually overcoming them and finding destructive new paths to toasty success.",0
"246","It’s lack of accessible controls or incentive for laboring through arduous stages, combined with the sloppy presentation of its story suggests that Aaru woke up a little prematurely.",0
"247","Submerged attempts to replace tension with curiosity as a motivating force, and largely succeeds even though its environmental storytelling isn’t as dense as it could’ve been.",0
"248","In the moments where Submerged rewarded inquisitiveness, I loved it. When it occasionally stumbled in that responsibility, I found myself wishing for a more polished and complete world to explore.",0
"249","Doom is a tale of two very different shooters (and one quirky creation tool). The single-player campaign's reverent worship of the series' roots results in an old-school run-and-gun shooter which feels like imitation Doom, a cover of an old hit which nails all the right power chords but isn't exactly transformative. The multiplayer's attempts to borrow from the new to reinvigorate the old results in an experience which won't satisfy either school of thought. SnapMap, meanwhile, is a blend of weird and simple and endearing.",0
"250","The divide between the highs and lows of The Last Guardian is staggering. For every wonderful moment of absolute beauty and emotional attachment to its lifelike companion, there’s an equal and opposite baffling moment that ruins the mood with frustrating controls and camera angles. But I found myself willing to put up with all of these hiccups if it meant experiencing any of its multitude of incredibly-beautiful moments.",0
"251","A good combat system and gorgeous visuals are significantly let down by an underwhelming and perfunctory narrative that can make progression a real chore. Whilst there are elements that work in isolation, Bravely Second doesn't manage to tie them together in a way that matches the quality of the original.",0
"252","There’s enough snappy dialogue and silliness in Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice to satisfy long-term series fans, and the conventional courtroom sequences still feel rewarding when you get on a roll and a witness starts to unravel. But the heavy-handed mysticism of its bloated middle act and the general lack of innovation makes for a less than essential entry in the Phoenix Wright saga on the whole.",0
"253","Both in combat and out, there are some clearly good ideas, especially the tense and dangerous Dark Zone. But they’re not spread evenly or interwoven cleanly enough to form a cohesive, consistently enjoyable loop.",0
"254","Ultimately, The Division’s overly busy, conflicted design philosophies drown its best ingredients in a bland slurry that never quite comes together into a cohesive dish.",0
"255","Next to every good thing The Division does, there hangs a big, ugly asterisk. That same open world is barren and unengaging, combat gets bogged down with samey waves of walking bullet sponges, and character progression is awkwardly fractured in inconvenient ways.",0
"256","While there was enough variety in the mechs to keep me playing through a full season of matches, the sub-par visuals distract, and big matchmaking issues made online wait times unbearable. It’s fun to play with friends, but try to take it for a spin before committing, if only to make sure your stomach can actually handle it.",0
"257","World of Final Fantasy is a humorous adventure that is just too cute for words, but its combat and exploration aren’t diverse enough to support a campaign nearly as long as this one. However, I did enjoy it for a long time - more than 30 hours - before it wore out its welcome.",0
"258","There are a lot of good ideas in Battlefleet Gothic: Armada, and it certainly looks like a great tactical space combat game. But it struggles to build that into a coherent whole, making it tough to recommend unless you’re willing to utterly dedicate yourself to fully comprehending the inaccessible systems of its combat.",0
"259","The beautiful Wii U graphics and playful humor stay true to the spirit of the Paper Mario franchise, but the story is straightforward and a bit bland.",0
"260","While it finds its strongest moments in its rewardingly rhythmic, precision-based one-on-one duels, an unwelcome level of tedium and occasionally cheap sequences — made even more frustrating by janky mechanics — keep the action from being as consistently strong as it is visually stylish.",0
"261","Being Batman in Akrham VR is a great way to more intimately experience Rocksteady's universe and to search for clues in this brief mystery. However, the world and characters around you are largely rigid and unresponsive to your actions, which leaves a lot on the table for a game about a character known as much for his brawn as he is for his brains.",0
"262","Its mechanics are solid but largely unoriginal, and its themes and world-building are genuinely great. And while it never reaches the originality and heights of its inspirations, it still manages to deliver an interesting world with one heck of a twist.",0
"263","Despite its improved HD veneer and tweaked controls, I just didn’t find the Amplitude of 2016 to be as addictive or long-lasting an experience as the Amplitude of 2003.",0
"264","Though the epilogue has some serious pacing problems, Attack on Titan is a fun, bloody take on the series.",0
"265","I was so happy this game was being made, but in the end I’m just as disappointed in how it turned out.",0
"266","A moderately successful execution of the standard 4X formula with a flair for leaders and enjoyably complex combat.",0
"267","The core idea behind Super Mario Maker is the ability to create, play, and share your creation, but the 3DS drops the ball on the last part of that credo. It’s worth noting that designing stages is as easy at it is convenient on the portable 3DS, but not having a larger platform to showcase unique creations left me wondering what the point is. It’s still an excellent way to play a bottomless pit of classic-style 2D Mario, though, and that makes it worth keeping in your pocket.",0
"268","A very predictable update to a long-running series of dancing games that shines in visual design and unique choreography but is very loose with its tracking of your body movements. It’s not going to teach you to be a professional dancer, and it honestly doesn’t really teach you how to be good at Just Dance itself. That said, it’s still a whole lot of fun to play, and the songs that aren’t locked behind a paywall are varied and, largely, recognisable.",0
"269","While this is the weakest episode in Batman’s Telltale series yet, my investment in the unpredictable, multi-layered plot hasn’t wavered, thanks to the critical state of each of Bruce Wayne’s relationships. Episode four’s first act felt like it was just filling in time for the season finale, but some conflicts have still been built upon, including showcasing how the people of Gotham are reacting to the intense political climate.",0
"270","Punch Club is tedious at times, thanks to an unfortunate level-down systems that artificially extend the road to the championship with grinding repetition, but its upgrades, stat growth, and more compensate with satisfying depth.",0
"271","If you’ve never played Arkham Asylum and Arkham City and own a current-gen console, Return to Arkham is a fine place to start. But for those who already own both on PC or last gen, there’s no real reason to pick this up beyond a rather uninspiring and technically disappointing graphical upgrade.",0
"272","All flash with little substance, Project X Zone 2 will please die-hard fans of its source material but few others.",0
"273","It’s a side-scrolling shooter with stock parts that I don’t foresee leaving a mark on the genre, but is at least worth a spin if you’ve got the patience for it and a thirst for a major challenge.",0
"274","The Flame in the Flood is a beautiful procedurally generated survival sim that gains a welcome sense of momentum from the need to stay on the move. Its unwieldy menus and tendency to crash ruins some of the fun, unfortunately, but not enough to diminish the strength of the hopeful, riverbound journey at its core.",0
"275","Throughout the early levels and into the more advanced stages, this fun, occasionally frustrating strategy game continues to offer plenty of reward for your time and effort, but lacks the character to make the spirit of the simulation as enticing as its systems.",0
"276","A brief, but mostly entertaining chapter in Rise of the Tomb Raider’s lore. While I would have happily swapped the return to the Soviet Installation for a new challenge tomb, its supernatural elements added a noticeably different feel and a welcome sense of tension to Lara’s new adventure.",0
"277","Wayward Sky is a good example of how well suited VR is for point-and-click style adventures. It uses perspective and gesture-based gameplay to immerse you in a world that is, on its own, a well made and inviting one. Though I’ll most likely forget forget much of its gameplay sooner than later, Wayward Sky’s setting and ambiance will stay with me long after.",0
"278","The staples of Mirror’s Edge remain refreshing and unique in the first-person genre in 2016, but Catalyst’s attempts to keep up with the open-world Joneses don’t always jive with its design strengths of movement and momentum. On top of that, muddy-looking console versions and a lame story filled with unlikable characters doom Mirror’s Edge’s return to fall short.",0
"279","The bottom line is if you haven’t played any three of these games, this is the best looking console version to date, and these enduring zombie-smashing games are still worth a playthrough. Outside of that, there’s nothing new in this Triple Pack to draw old Frank West fans back to experience the chaos again before he returns in Dead Rising 4 this December.",0
"280","Despite being a relatively-simple 3D platformer, Bound’s fantastic sense of movement and strange, dream-like world make it utterly unique. It’s a testament to phenomenal controls and sense of grace that I was able to set aside the camera and design flaws, and fully immerse myself in this strange, beautiful story.",0
"281","The cast of Battleborn is fantastic; I've enjoyed exploring the ins and outs of characters like the steampunk sniper Marquis and fungal healer Miko, and every time I play I'm focused on earning further access to the unique roster. However, there’s no interesting story for them to take part in, and a lack of interesting stages and multiplayer modes inspiring me to power through the slow unlocking process.",0
"282","LEGO Marvel's Avengers is fun, but unfortunately restricted by stubbornly sticking to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",0
"283","Edge of Nowhere stands out in the current library of VR games only because it’s one of the longer and more polished games out there, but compared to the conventional third-person action-stealth games it closely emulates it’s competent but unremarkable. [Tested with Oculus Rift]",0
"284","In a way it’s a nice change-up to the established formula to date but the drab and gloomy farm isn’t an especially memorable environment. It is, however, the trickiest series of hits this season thanks to a big push for stealth, and probably the lengthiest episode so far.",0
"285","On the whole, Hyrule Warriors Legends is an ok experience for New 3DS owners. Despite adding five awesome characters and some smart control-swapping and fast-travel options, the performance problems and shabby-looking graphics make it difficult to appreciate all the fanservice that’s packed in here. The poorly downgraded textures, hideous menus, and pop-in are all real eyesores. And stay away from 3D if you prefer a stable framerate.",0
"286","Dead Star has the basics of combat and ship balance right, to the point that even losses have their fun moments. Its primary shortcoming is that it allows too great an advantage for pre-made groups, which is especially a problem considering the wonky matchmaker.",0
"287","For a few hours at least, Final Fantasy Explorers is a charming little adventure that’s fun to play alone with your monster buddies or with real-life friends. But repetitive quests, the lack of a serious challenge until late in the story and a poor travel system eventually broke the charm spell that Explorers had cast upon me.",0
"288","True to its title, The Walking Dead: Michonne - Episode 1 is all about one character, somewhat to the detriment of the story and other characters. Michonne is so well done, though, from her impressive survival skills to the hollow look in her eyes, that she easily carries the entire episode.",0
"289","Battleborn's fun heroes and leveling will keep you hooked despite a lack of content.",0
"290","A lot of effort was clearly put into Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization, because almost every aspect of its gameplay has an underlying set of properties and nuances to come to grips with. While I usually love that kind of complexity, here it rarely felt meaningful or even coherent. Paired with a story that lacks the stakes and urgency of the source material, it leaves Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization feeling pretty tepid aside from its enjoyable combat.",0
"291","The staples of Mirror’s Edge remain refreshing and unique in the first-person genre in 2016, but Catalyst’s attempts to keep up with the open-world Joneses don’t always jive with its design strengths of movement and momentum. On top of that, muddy-looking console versions and a lame story filled with unlikable characters doom Mirror’s Edge’s return to fall short.",0
"292","Reanimating this limp corpse of a survival game in high definition only brings back the disappointment I felt when I played it the first time.",0
"293","The cast of Battleborn is fantastic; I've enjoyed exploring the ins and outs of characters like the steampunk sniper Marquis and fungal healer Miko, and every time I play I'm focused on earning further access to the unique roster. However, there’s no interesting story for them to take part in, and a lack of interesting stages and multiplayer modes inspiring me to power through the slow unlocking process.",0
"294","It might not hold a candle to Dirt Rally in its car selection or look and feel, but it’s not bad for developer Kylotonn’s sophomore effort on the series. If Milestone’s stint turned you off, as it did me, now could be a good time to get reacquainted.",0
"295","It’s a forgettable entry in an outstanding series that just doesn’t measure up because of its story problems, overwhelming inventory management, and horrible predictability.",0
"296","With the Dead Island Definitive Edition, Dead Island and Dead Island Riptide have never looked so good. The use of Dying Light's graphics engine means almost every setting looks better and more realistic than it did at the start of the decade, but it unfortunately doesn’t run any better now than it did then.",0
"297","It’s great to have something made just for fans, though even Luffy's biggest supporters will be let down by the brief, limited campaign. At its best, this wild and crazy fighter makes for a fun distraction for folks who've been dying for more One Piece games to get localized.",0
"298","Michonne is undoubtedly a strong star, but the rest of the characters fall short as a supporting cast — they’re mostly backdrops and mirrors for Michonne to look into. It doesn’t hurt her character development, but it takes some of the emotion out of otherwise-powerful scenes that clearly affect Michonne deeply.",0

"300","Reminds me a lot of the PlayStation 2-era Evolution-developed WRC games; it’s an earnest attempt to capture the spirit of a niche motorsport series and, most importantly, it feels good to play thanks to a wide selection of tight-quarters race tracks, and decent handling. It might not hold a candle to Dirt Rally in its car selection or look and feel, but it’s not bad for developer Kylotonn’s sophomore effort on the series.",0
"301","Adr1ft doesn't pioneer any new types of gameplay with VR, which is a shame because it desperately needs some variety in that area. However, it does benefit greatly from blocking off the rest of the world, creating a feeling of isolation that aligns with what your character is experiencing. Floating out over the Earth and looking down from this perspective is truly impressive. [VR Tested]",0

"303","Perhaps its biggest issue, at least on console, is its shoddy overall performance. While a mid or even lower range PC can handle ReCore just fine even at max settings, the Xbox One version rarely if ever manages to make it to 30 fps. It never interfered with my ability to play in any significant manner, but it definitely degrades the visual joy of exploring Far Eden a bit.",0
"304","The Park doesn’t really bring anything new to the horror table, but honestly, that’s okay. Its 90 minutes are filled with an impressive atmosphere, interesting themes, and spooky places to poke around. While some of the attractions are a bit long in the tooth, The Park provides enough tension and scares to warrant a playthrough from any horror fan.",0
"305","One Piece: Burning Blood understands what makes the pirate life so compelling in the source material, and is fairly successful in channelling that roguish spirit into its chaotic fights. That flashy, firm commitment to action will feel welcoming to One Piece's biggest fans, but confusing to everyone else.",0
"306","Some of its ideas conflict with each other (such as permadeath and teammate revival), its procedural generation doesn’t offer much in the way of replayability, and its intentional vagueness can be frustrating, but it’s good for at least a few monster-smashing runs before it gets old thanks to enjoyable combat mechanics, cheeky humor, and the promise of mystery.",0
"307","Controls are awkward at best, making it tough to appreciate how good the combat is, but there's a lot of fun here, especially in the eight multiplayer modes for up to 32 players.",0
"308","There's a lot to love in the way Clockwork Empires attempts to break up the construction sim framework with Lovecraftian creatures and almost assured destruction, but it often takes too long to get to the best parts and fills that time with dull busywork. For most of the hours spent, it's largely a standard colonization simulator that's hampered with an unwieldy user interface and weak AI.",0
"309","Its world, while interesting to explore for a good while, is ultimately too big with too little happening in it to be a totally serviceable housing for the strong combat and platforming gameplay within. It feels like a great, arcadey action platformer spread across too big a canvas, and it asks you to draw back over the same lines a few too many times.",0
"310","Much like you'd see in a seedy 1980s movie, Trials of the Blood Dragon is like a pretty good first hit of a drug. The buzz is short and mostly enjoyable, but it's so different that you might get hooked on the series.",0
"311","It's got a great gateway due to the story's ties to Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, the flashy neon art, the constant pop-culture references, and fantastic techno score. Just realize that the shooting is bad and that you may come down from this high way earlier than you'd expect. But if this is your first Trial, know that there's lots more to consume.",0

"313","A fast-paced, energetic, deliberately absurd action shooter that’s mostly competent at everything it tries to do. Stunningly crafted, downright epic environments and tight, responsive gamepad controls steal the show. But it certainly doesn’t pull off anything innovative or revolutionary, and the whole experience is dragged down by spiky difficulty, half-baked RPG mechanics, and poorly constructed (though varied) boss battles.",0
"314","Fast RMX may not be the perfect anti-gravity racing package, but it certainly offers high-speed racing and a lot of tracks to challenge yourself on. It’s a shame that the online multiplayer offering is so barebones, and that the time trial mode is currently AWOL, but in lieu of an official Wipeout or F-Zero this is a solid option to get your arcade racing fix on the Nintendo Switch.",0
"315","While its antiquated roots cause some minor frustration with unreliable hitboxes and unnecessary grinding, the foundational combat and exploration is still engaging and fun after 30 years. From long-time Wonder Boy fans to platformer enthusiasts who’ve never heard of it until now, you’ll likely be able to find whimsical fun and a neat bit of genre history in this charming adventure.",0
"316","Rime’s superficial beauty and interesting mysteries provided enough enjoyment to make me willing to put up with its shallow and familiar elements under the hood. While nothing about Rime is necessarily bad, you can find more interesting versions of nearly every single element of it in other, better games.",0
"317","Halo Wars 2 will scratch a real-time strategy itch and give you a dose of Halo-Universe flavor with a decent story, but it won’t go much deeper than that. A run-of-the-mill campaign, controls that hamper micromanagement, conspicuous bugs, and multiplayer that relies on luck limit its long-term appeal, but its fast and flashy action makes it fun for a while.",0

"320","With three hits and three duds from Capcom/Disney years that you might remember with varying levels of fondness, the Disney Afternoon Collection is clearly aimed at children of the 90s. I have trouble seeing its appeal to anyone else. But if vintage duck-based platformers are your thing, grab a Capri Sun and a handful of Gushers and invite your friends over to play.",0
"321","While it’s a shame that its dungeon dwelling enemies are far too easily exploited, Blaster Master Zero is ultimately an enjoyable reimagining of a largely overlooked 8-bit classic thanks to the rewarding exploration-focussed structure of its side-scrolling overworld. There are enough secret rooms and power-ups to seek out (including an additional ending), that I was compelled to scour every last inch over the course of my eight-hour completion time. It’s a good reboot; just not a Masterful one.",0
"322","Star Trek: Bridge Crew feels like a promising first draft of a fantastic Trek simulator, but it only goes boldly for a few hours. After the novelty of finally sitting on a beautiful Federation starship bridge wears off and you’ve exhausted the handful of mission types, all that’s left is the goofy physical comedy of messing around with your friends or strangers in VR.",0
"323","Poochy & Yoshi’s Woolly World remains one of the cutest games around. Even though most of the tactile charm of the Wii U original has been lost to the 3DS’s technical limitations, there’s still plenty of fun to be uncovered in this colourful and often inventive platformer. Incidentally, it also brings some of the happiest, catchiest music ever to the 3DS.",0
"324","Because of its diminished graphics and clumsy combat controls, Skyrim VR definitely isn’t the best way to actually play Skyrim. However, if you leave the difficulty on the default lowest setting and roam the world as a god who can slay enemies with the flick of the wrist, it’s a good way to experience Bethesda’s legendary RPG from a whole new perspective.",0
"325","I'm glad that, in NHL 18, EA continues to seek out new players for the NHL series with smart upgrades to the training system and the exciting and accessible NHL Threes mode. Those are positive strides, but the rest of the modes and features are starting to feel too familiar. If you're someone who's been following the NHL series for years, you aren't getting anything drastically new here to alter the balance or restore excitement. The EASHL is still enjoyable with a great group of buddies, and the other offline modes are decent, but this series is in need of some new approaches to gameplay and refreshes of older modes.",0

"329","Despite a lackluster ending to “Above the Law,” A New Frontier’s third episode kept me invested in Javi’s story, if not the plot as a whole. I’m a bit more wary heading into the latter half of the season after the jarring number of character entrances and exits in this episode, but if the strong character work continues, I’m more than willing to roll through the bumps of this mid-season episode. Telltale has found a sharp lens in Javi through which to analyze the ideas of family as bonds we’re forced into and choose to make ourselves. And he’s a lens, even in the season’s weakest moments, I still find myself wanting to help survive.",0
"330","Slithering up simple structures in Snake Pass is one of the most mechanically satisfying video game ideas I’ve ever experience, and it effectively creates a sensation that feels the way maneuvering like a snake might. The camera and checkpoint systems aren’t great, but the concept still managed to hook me for the five hours it took wrap up the campaign. And in the end, I wanted to go back and replay stages to round up all the collectibles I missed.",0
"331","The Switch version of Resident Evil: Revelations 2 capably handles this entertaining horror experience. The frame rate is steady and the motion controls are mostly worth using. Load times can drag on, but they aren’t frequent enough to be a big issue. If you appreciate the thrill of sharing intimate zombie encounters with a friend, the ability to play this local co-op story with one Joy-Con a piece makes it a handy game to have on your Switch.",0
"332","Yooka-Laylee contains all the pieces needed for a fun, enjoyable throwback to the 3D collectathons of the 64-bit era. The characters are charming and funny, your set of abilities is vast and entertaining, and four out of five of the worlds are fun playgrounds to explore. While it lacks the heart and polish of some of its incredible predecessors, it’s a good reminder that this genre, once thought to be dead, still has some life left in it.",0

"334","Matterfall succeeds in adapting Housemarque’s trademark style of fast, action-packed, arcadey action to the 2D platformer genre, but it feels like a puzzle half solved. There’s virtually no content here after you finish its exceptionally short campaign, outside of some harder difficulty modes and a global leaderboard to climb, and its level design isn’t well-suited for replay value. It’s a ton of fun while it lasts, but once it’s over it’s hard to not be left with a feeling of “Is that it?”",0
"335","NBA Live 18’s simplistic and fluid mechanics make for an approachable game of NBA, or WNBA, basketball.

It’s great to just tap your Skylander on the right thumbstick, like you would with an Amiibo, and have it be recognized by the hardware in a matter of seconds. This is our first chance to play Skylanders on the go, and this takes the the idea of being able to bring your Imaginators to your friends’ houses to adventure together to a whole new level.",0
"339","While it’s the weakest episode so far, More Than A Feeling still has some moments of payoff for leadership successes (and failures) earlier in the series.",0
"340","A very predictable update to a long-running series of dancing games that shines in visual design and unique choreography but is very loose with its tracking of your body movements. It’s not going to teach you to be a professional dancer, and it honestly doesn’t really teach you how to be good at Just Dance itself. That said, it’s still a whole lot of fun to play, and the songs that aren’t locked behind a paywall are varied and, largely, recognisable.",0
"341","LEGO Worlds is commendable for its environmental diversity and the power of its creative tools to build anything you can dream of or manipulate every castle, hillside, and forest in sight. Unfortunately, fiddly menus, a pretty terrible combat system, and at times clunky and unfriendly construction controls weigh down on the wonder of finding and creating. Despite all this, I still find myself drawn back into it to discover what more the designers have hidden in the world-generation code, as coming across a massive ruined castle or an active volcano for the first time is always a treat - and an inspiration for what I want to build next.",0
"342","“Thicker Than Water,” other than its satisfying ending, is the season’s weakest episode yet. Little that precedes the action-packed conclusion feels like it has much, if any, weight to the ongoing story I’m invested in — namely Javi’s life and his relationships with Kate, Clem, and David. I’m absolutely on the hook for the season finale after that strong start and thrilling ending — I just wish everything before it hadn’t felt so thin.",0

"345","Thanks to the imprecision of its shooting controls and the cheap behaviour of its AI, I could never really develop any confidence in Tokyo 42’s frustrating combat.

But until a head-to-head mode is added, it’s not much more than a set of unchallenging training scenarios broken up by far too much overwrought dialogue. I had plenty of fun with it, but didn’t get the kind of edge-of-my-seat decision-making moments that turned the tide of a difficult battle I could find in similar games.",0
"354","A broad and goofy arsenal of unique weapons and gadgets and the ability to switch characters on the fly to access complementary abilities offers some solid combat and good mindless fun, but due to some unpolished writing and repetitive environments and enemy types, it doesn't fully live up to its heroic potential.",0

But everything you’re forced to do on a planet’s surface is boring at best and an annoying chore at worst, and that kills a lot of momentum.",0
"385","The premiere sets the season up for an emotionally charged and powerful arc, but heavy exposition and character building make this a slow, gradual build.",0
"386","the fact that it recycles so much of the 2016 game’s material means that in order to get to the new season 2 content you must first wade through a rehashed story mode with its dull sidequests and tedious dialogue choices.",0
"387","The toys are unnecessary, but Starlink: Battle for Atlas is still an enjoyable space adventure.",0
"388","Luigi's Mansion is a fun exploratory adventure game that remains pretty enjoyable despite some annoying control issues and design anachronisms. A full remake that embraced a more modern and polished battle system along with better puzzle design would have made it even better.",0
"389","The fact that it recycles so much of the 2016 game’s material means that in order to get to the new season 2 content you must first wade through a rehashed story mode with its dull sidequests and tedious dialogue choices.",0
"390","The campaign itself can feel drawn out at times thanks to a less-than-stellar story and some obviously recycled content, but there’s a real thrill in executing covert missions and putting all the pieces together like a master spy.",0
"391","The War Machine is an uneven DLC with a great new multiplayer map and Zombies chapter but unfortunate issues elsewhere.",0
"392","Runner 3 is a fun, challenging experience with a weird, charming aesthetic brought down by out-of-date graphics. Playing the same level dozens of times wears thin, but its difficulty never feels unfair.",0
"393","Pathfinder: Kingmaker delivers a fantastic story and a deep character system to dive into. Without a Dungeon Master on the player’s side to smooth out the rough edges however, its balance is wildly inconsistent and its event design, flawed. So many promising ideas fall well short in execution.",0
"394","Last Year: The Nightmare is among the best the asymmetrical survival-horror genre has to offer so far. While it’s light on content and has some severe bugs, the rewarding class-based gameplay and great killer diversity makes each match feel slightly different and equally exciting.",0
"395","Its platforming is okay but unimaginative, and its best ideas, like the tree jumping and singing affecting the world, remain underused. It can be a beautiful game at times, especially with regards to its music and audio design, but not so much so that it hides its rougher edges and undeveloped concepts.",0
"396","Chasm is a platformer I thoroughly enjoyed playing through once, but I’m not rushing back for more.",0
"397","The fact that it recycles so much of the 2016 game’s material means that in order to get to the new season 2 content you must first wade through a rehashed story mode with its dull sidequests and tedious dialogue choices.",0
"398","Hours of Darkness is a clever and fun but brief twist on the Far Cry formula. Its new approach to Guns for Hire AI companions gives you something other than yourself to worry about during battles, and its use of perks as a reward for stealth kills encourages my favorite style of play in an interesting way, but can bring your momentum to a screeching halt when you slip up.",0
"399","Borderlands 2 VR sacrifices co-op, but returning to Pandora from this closer perspective is still a largely fun shoot and loot experience when played with the DualShock 4.",0
"400","While some of the exposition-heavy conversations drone on longer than they should, it ends on a powerful note foreshadowing some difficult lessons Clementine has yet to learn about what it means to grow up and lead in a post-society world.",0
"401","A very blunt attempt to fuse two beloved games, Dark Souls and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, into one challenging 2D action-platformer. Developer White Rabbit shows a strong understanding of what made each of them great but glosses over fundamentals that all great games need, such as responsive controls and an understandable game world, and falls short of its promise.",0
"402","H1Z1 checks all of the boxes needed to be a competent battle royale game, but in its main mode it lacks a distinctive sense of character. Without the realistic depth and modular weaponry of PUBG or the wacky base-building antics of Fortnite, its streamlined design rushes toward straightforward, fast-paced action instead and ends up being dull as often as it is exciting. The more interesting thing about H1Z1 is its innovative Auto Royale mode, which translates battle royale mechanics to vehicular combat in a way we haven’t seen done better elsewhere.",0
"403","Below is a gorgeous, atmospheric dungeon crawler that is difficult to take in at the pace it deserves because of oppressive survival mechanics.",0
"404","With or without the unnecessary toys, Starlink: Battle for Atlas is a commendable space adventure. Even with the repetitive grind and randomly scattershot space combat, this is a great-looking, gratifying game of strategic action and environmental exploration. Switch owners are undoubtedly the winners, but there’s something here to enjoy on any platform.",0
"405","Overall, compared to its competitors Fable Fortune is lacking polish and some basic features, and its gameplay is a little more linear. But it does have The Dog and all the other characters and humour that made Fable special, and that makes it a fun way to dive back into a treasured series.",0
"406","The straightforward simplicity of Darksiders III is a refreshing change of pace after exploring so many dense open-world games. That simplicity doesn’t refer to the combat or boss battles, though, which are complex and almost startlingly unforgiving. Its throwback philosophy is comfort food for action gamers of a certain age, but it would’ve been nice to see the third game in the series introduce some new concepts to relaunch Darksiders in the modern age.",0
"407","A grey second act that ultimately sets us up nicely for a far brighter finale.",0
"408","Fe is a short-lived platformer that still manages to outstay its welcome in some regards. Its platforming is okay but unimaginative, and its best ideas, like the tree jumping and singing affecting the world, remain underused. It can be a beautiful game at times, especially with regards to its music and audio design, but not so much so that it hides its rougher edges and undeveloped concepts.",0
"409","Vampyr is a slow burn of an RPG, taking its time to ramp up its intriguing blend of science and the supernatural in an elaborately gloomy version of London. When it gets going you can see the potential of the way it offers you more power if you consume its interesting citizens. But Vampyr never commits to this idea to the point where I felt I needed to make that sacrifice to succeed in its relatively simple combat, which leaves it feeling toothless and vulnerable to having a lot of its fun sucked away by technical issues, despite its genuinely engaging story.",0
"410","Below simply leans too hard on roguelike and crafting elements, which create an urgent pace and conflict with its more admirable design ideas.",0
"411","Its platforming is okay but unimaginative, and its best ideas, like the tree jumping and singing affecting the world, remain underused. It can be a beautiful game at times, especially with regards to its music and audio design, but not so much so that it hides its rougher edges and undeveloped concepts.",0
"412","As it stands at launch, it’s genuinely good fun with friends, but progressing to Pirate Legend is a long grind. Sea of Thieves needs a lot more briny depth before it’s the amazing voyage we’d hoped for, but so far the great cooperative moments are a good start.",0
"413","For competitive players who want a mix of survival and crafting, Rust is the best there is; for everyone else, there are plenty of other games.",0
"414","The Crew 2 is big, confident, and stuffed with arcade racing action – land, sea, and air. There’s undoubtedly something still charming about a racing game that lets us drive an F1 car across the Golden Gate bridge, fly a Spitfire through the Grand Canyon, and crash a monster truck through Central Park, but its uneven presentation, lack of events that use its best features, and absent PvP is a bummer.",0
"415","The straightforward simplicity of Darksiders III is a refreshing change of pace after exploring so many dense open-world games.

"416","Conan Exiles captures the brutality of the source material, but weak combat and grindy crafting make it an often slow and arduous survival game.",0
"417","Even if it falls short of becoming a worthy successor to the likes of Chrono Trigger, Lost Sphear really does capture the essence of classic role-playing games in a lot of ways. When it's not bogging itself down in overwrought mechanics, this RPG really can spark a sense of nostalgia. Its writing, environments, battle system, and music all evoke the best moments of bygone days. And even if it doesn't quite hit the heights it aspires to, it does a fine job of rekindling some fond memories.",0
"418","There’s definitely fun to be had with My Hero One’s Justice. It’s super easy to pick up and play, the action is fast and beautiful to look at, and it does a great job of adapting the quirks and abilities from the anime to a 3D arena fighter. That fun eventually starts to fade away due to shallow combat and a weak story mode, but overall, it’s not a bad first endeavor.",0
"419","The stories told of its misfit characters are bleak, witty, tense, and ready to shine a light on their flaws. And yet, like the devilish, grinning masks the populace has donned in conformity, you can’t help but notice what’s just below the surface.",0
"420","Even those who consider themselves Final Fantasy completionists aren’t going to have enough story content to keep them playing for long. That’s frustrating, because when its various parts all come together in harmony it is a fun, unique team fighting game.",0
"421","What’s here is an amazing foundation for a social experience that’s beautifully realized , and that makes it frustrating that its gameplay loop is so repetitive and its progression is so stagnant.",0
"422","Although survival and crafting are fairly manageable, running through randomly generated towns, streets, or abandoned fields unfortunately shows that We Happy Few can’t hide from the ghost of its own past, no matter how much Joy you take.",0
"423","Darksiders III is a straightforward action game that isn't afraid to throw some serious old-school challenges at you.",0

"427","Survive might not compare well to the tactical espionage action that’s defined the Metal Gear series we know and love, but its oddly hit-or-miss combo of some solid old ideas and some clumsy new ones has at least some appeal.",0
"428","Extinction lands in that awkward position where, yeah, it’s usually fun - but you’re not really missing anything incredible by giving it a pass.",0
"429","The game doesn't advance the wider narrative very far, the new mechanics don't really add a great deal and the mission designs rarely explore new gameplay possibilities...That said, there's a lot to like; the game is undeniably solid, while the multiplayer offers a unique experience.",1
"430","As it is, it reminds me of avant-garde art or haute cuisine; interesting and bold but made for a small group of devoted connoisseurs. Those of a certain palate are sure to love its humor, weirdness and replayability but the broader gaming audience is likely to find it more of an acquired taste.",1
"431","As it is, VVVVVV is still a spike-lined, death-packed good time. Its steeper price and wimpy 3D just make it feel like more of a straightforward PC port and less like something truly special for the eShop.",1
"432","Taken out of the context of its fiction, People Can Fly would have something fun but forgettable on their hands, but the way Bulletstorm fits together results in something cool and memorable.",1
"433","A great surprise. Sure, the gameplay formula is typical Fallout -- fetch quests, exploration, killing, and moral decision making -- but it's wrapped in a genuinely humorous package.",1
"434","The story is good enough to recommend this game despite its relatively weak gameplay.",1
"435","A clever twist on tower defense that will rope back in gamers that think they've had enough of the well-worn formula.",1
"436","There is a huge world to explore, thousands of zombies to kill, and tons of side quests to take. Here on the other side of a 25-hour playthrough -- where I skipped a lot of side quests after Act 1 -- I'm anxious to get back into Dead Island, and despite the game's flaws, that's not something I say often.",1
"437","It manages to straddle pure tank simulation and shooter action to produce something that, despite being flawed, remains genuinely fun.",1
"438","It looks great, it's got a lot of personality, it tells an entertaining story and it's great fun to play. A few frustrating difficulty spikes and the story's rather premature ending are the only negatives.",1
"439","Weird cut-scenes and clunky use of the touch screen aside, this is a beautiful and fun game that fighter fans should make it a point to check out.",1
"440","Stunlock's game largely succeeds, and though it's not the prettiest piece of software on the planet, it's definitely one of the most entertaining.",1
"441","Pets puts the series and franchise back on track and continues to make its virtual worlds even more fleshed out. As always, this expansion isn't going to make any non-Sims player a convert, but if you're still enjoying your digital families, this is a good expansion to pick up.",1
"442","Mighty Switch Force is a great first effort from WayForward for Nintendo's 3DS, but it has its issues. The game lacks length, and its Par times will unnecessarily encourage players to rush through their first playthroughs – making the game seem even shorter and stealing away some of their sense of the success.",1
"443","The innovative mix of various RPG sub-genres results in an intriguing and incredibly fun overall package. However, given the original came out so recently, it's rather confusing why this barely enhanced version even exists.",1
"444","I just wish they'd taken this project all the way, instead of stopping with ""good enough.""",1
"445","Might and Magic Heroes VI may have some issues with battlefield tactics in the late game and its story, but the strategy remains a blast nonetheless.",1
"446","It may be the closest thing to X-COM: UFO Defense we’ve seen in 20 years, but its frustrations make it tougher to recommend than it should be.",1
"447","Most importantly, though, the various types of gameplay that the developers have thrown together may not be all that amazing on their own, but the elements work together to create a well-paced, easy-to-understand game that is good fun for anyone.",1
"448","In Red Orchestra 2 carelessness is swiftly punished and careful positioning and teamwork ultimately rewarded. It's a game for the patient, and despite its slower pace, no less exhilarating than any other shooter on the market.",1
"449","Who's That Flying?! is enjoyable, funny, and cute. The story mode kind of fell flat for me as each city's three levels felt similar and dragged a bit, but that's just a portion of the game.",1
"450","It's beautiful, well-written and cleverly-designed and if its only flaws were a flaky scroll button and blurry cutscenes, it would warrant an unmitigated thumbs up.",1
"451","With addictive gameplay, gorgeous and creative use of 3D, and some amazing new control options, portable gaming enthusiasts have no reason to pass this title up.",1
"452","Though it has a few issues with regards to Blendo's reliance on randomization, such problems shouldn't turn you away if you're looking for an offbeat gaming experience.",1
"453","The writing is really good in general (despite one tasteless bit of dialogue where Hector calls some gangsters ""homos"" instead of ""homies""), and the puzzles are fun, but don't expect anything out of the ordinary gameplay wise.",1
"454","Axis' presentation just plain doesn't quite stack up to other versions on the market - most notable Tetris DS - and the uninspired use of Miis comes off as more lazy than fun.",1
"455","It may not be the best or most original action game, but it's a fine first outing for the franchise, and a rare gem for Warhammer fans.",1
"456","Whether you're looking for a new, solid shooter to play or something set in a unique, horror-filled atmosphere, F.E.A.R. 3 has something for you. You won't find the be-all, end-all shooter experience with F.E.A.R. 3, but you're still bound to have a lot of fun.",1
"457","Remains fun despite its problems, and makes for some great local competitive play.",1
"458","There isn't a wealth of game here, but what is here is thoroughly enjoyable. Fortix 2 proves that, 30 years later, the Qix formula remains fun.",1
"459","It's great to have an opportunity to revisit Deus Ex: Human Revolution, and The Missing Link is a substantial, tense and exciting piece of downloadable content that's far more than just filler.",1
"460","Another great adventure game. If you want to get into a classic point-and-click adventure series, and are looking for something a bit more mature than many of TellTale's other titles, you have to try Hector.",1
"461","The disposable story and flat characters shouldn't be surprising for a game like this, but other issues like a the lack of enemy variety and short overall length are disappointing. Despite that, the versatility of the weapon system and flashy visuals make Flying Wild Hog's product exciting from beginning to end.",1
"462","It's a couple of features short of being a classic, but its compelling game of football has found a comfortable home on the handheld. It suggests that greater things are to come from this relationship, but there's enough here to keep players going until then.",1
"463","There's a lot more to both it and the original than a celestial bump and grind.",1
"464","Gray Matter's winding story and masterful presentation captivate enough to hold everything together, particularly as the tale reaches its bizarre climax in the final chapters.",1
"465","I dig the humor, the puzzles, the voicework and the setting. I think the story takes the characters to some goofy places in the end and I didn't feel like I'd accomplished much when everything was said and done, but that's far from a deal-breaker.",1
"466","The 3D really is a big addition in this case, as well, allowing you to see environments more clearly and complete jumps that would otherwise be much more difficult. And with the small number of 3DS games on the market right now, you could certainly do worse than LEGO Pirates.",1
"467","Truly impressive just as it is, and it deserves the attention of any Nintendo fans who've either always been curious about this series or just love flying through the sky to blow stuff up.",1
"468","A fun and satisfying conclusion to TellTale's darkest adventure game franchise.",1
"469","What brings the game down considerably is the repetitiveness of the main combat, and the fact that the initially inspired level and art designs take a nosedive about halfway through.",1
"470","Terribly cheesy in all the right ways.",1
"471","There's still a lot of good here, and if you haven't played Mount & Blade before then this is a fine place to start, but for fans of the series, Mount & Blade: With Fire and Sword simply isn't a must-have expansion.",1
"472","It's merely capable, with occasional flashpoints of brilliance.",1
"473","The narrative could be stronger and there's a lack of variety in terms of creatures occupying the park, but these are minor complaints about an otherwise enjoyable time.",1
"474","Hoard is a refreshing little multiplayer game that lets you be the bad guy for a change. Designed for short matches against other players, it's a somewhat limited experience, but burninating the countryside is definitely a lot of fun.",1
"475","While Gabrielle's Ghostly Grooves 3D provides a creative, memorable world full of lovable characters, the gameplay itself comes off as kind of run-of-the-mill. Still, if you love rhythm games, Ghostly Grooves brings enough personality, laughs and fun to make it well worth your time.",1
"476","Pyramids isn't the most original game and nothing about it will surprise or amaze you too much, but it's done well overall and a good value for its asking price.",1
"477","Xevious is still a game design that's nearly 30 years old, so all the new bells and whistles in the world won't be enough to get some modern fans interested in this old classic again. But the 3D Classics upgrades have made me more of a fan of it than I ever was before, and that's certainly enough for me to recommend you all give it a try too.",1
"478","A stellar action puzzle hybrid with tight controls, Monkey Ball 3D is the best Monkey Ball game since the original, and Sega's found some cool ways to implement the system's 3D functionality and make it relevant to the gameplay.",1
"479","You're still likely to want a bit more depth and surprise in the tactical game, but the campaign is full of tense moments that are sure to keep you coming back for more.",1
"480","Thirty Flights of Loving gets off to a fascinating start before completely throwing any and all expectations you might form during its first few minutes into the wood chipper.",1
"481","The RPG elements and to-the-point action all make for some solid gaming, glitches and all. It's a shame so many glaring issues hold such an ambitious endeavor back from the greatness its developers were clearly aiming for.",1
"482","FTL's situations lack some variety and the randomness of the game as a whole can be frustrating, but it largely makes up for these flaws through its intense combat and intuitive and deep micromanagement options.",1
"483","So, while the Wii U version of Tekken Tag Tournament 2 doesn't change up many of the problems that we had with its original release, it adds some more casual-friendly modes for the Nintendo crowd.",1
"484","I love Kat and totally dig most of the superhero story, but the cumbersome combat in latter missions definitely had me cursing at my handheld.",1
"485","This is a demanding, skill-based multiplayer game that's as satisfying now as it ever was, but it's for a specific kind of player. If you're not willing to learn to play different than you're used to, look elsewhere. Otherwise, this is a top-tier tactics game that will probably share the long-tailed legacy of its predecessors.",1
"486","If you've been meaning to check out the series, but never have, then Rebellion is the perfect entry point. However, if you've been a loyal fan, you're likely to be disappointed by the tweak-first, content-second approach that Rebellion offers.",1
"487","One of the surprising things about Crusader Kings II is that, for a Paradox title, it's actually relatively easy to pick up.",1
"488","New Art Academy is an improvement on the original, with more thorough, detailed lessons and a wider range of options, though it's also a missed opportunity.",1
"489","The RPG elements and to-the-point action all make for some solid gaming, glitches and all. It's a shame so many glaring issues hold such an ambitious endeavor back from the greatness its developers were clearly aiming for.",1
"490","It's independent, and the journey isn't always smooth. But cookie-cutter it is not, nor is it garish or sexist or silly or mindless. If you are a patient person who appreciates grey matter workouts and ""Eureka"" moments, and if you are willing to forgive imperfections, check it out. Gaming needs titles and developers like this.",1
"491","It's fun, competitive, and features short sessions that normally last under a half-hour. If you're an RTS gamer looking for a new battlefield, you'll definitely want to give Wargame a try.",1
"492","Natural Selection 2 isn't great only because it's different, but because it does asymmetrical multiplayer so damn well, offering up a variety of experiences in one small game.",1
"493","No, Captain's Booty is not an exceptional follow-up to Borderlands 2, but it is a good piece of content that gives plenty of reasons for anyone to jump back into Pandora.",1
"494","A fast-paced, well playing fighter that makes few concessions on the Vita. While the game's modes are pretty sparse and the new touch mode is a dud, there's still a lot to be excited about if you're a fighting fan with a brand new Vita.",1
"495","The artful way the characters' abilities allow you to move through the environment are entrancing, and the meticulously crafted levels create moments that made me look and feel awesome.",1
"496","There are a few compromises here and there, but they're negligible. The addition of touchpad shooting and the less successful touchscreen passing transform FIFA Vita into a very different experience – it's more fun, more jubilant, and accessible.",1
"497","It's an accurate and impressive pinball simulator that controls well and has some great 3D visuals. If you have any interest in pinball the way it was originally meant to be played, or are looking to get into the pastime, Zen Pinball 3D should be right up your alley.",1
"498","Like its competition, Chivalry hasn't quite perfected the formula for medieval warfare, but it's a violent, fun time nonetheless.",1
"499","It's with the addition of Dimensions that Trion Worlds really breaks new ground, providing players with a powerful tool to create truly unique constructions.",1
"500","Despite a dearth of immediately obvious changes, Baldur's Gate has aged well, and new players will find many hours' worth of fun if they approach it with an understanding of its increasingly antiquated framework.",1
"501","Its individual elements suffer from a ""jack of all trades"" mediocrity, but they combine to form a whole that hints at greatness without ever quite achieving it. But thanks to a set of mod tools included in the release, it's possible the devoted community itself can push it up that final step.",1
"502","The understated aesthetic design and unusual co-op puzzles will absorb you for the game's duration – the wit and personality of the writing, though, will stay with you for much longer.",1
"503","Quantum Conundrum's inventive puzzles put your brain to satisfying work. Everything surrounding the challenges feels a little empty and could use some of the rest of the game's ingenuity. But a disappointing ending and lack of visual detail shouldn't keep you from the thrill of inter-dimensional puzzle solving.",1
"504","A smart, polished and intelligent game of countless permutations. Its strength lies in how carefully and how cleverly it's balanced, as well as how it rewards all kinds of playing styles. We haven't seen a strategy game quite like this in a while.",1
"505","The new features don't add a lot to the package, making it hard to recommend Virtua Tennis to anyone that has been playing it on the console.",1
"506","The third episode of Penny Arcade Adventures looks and plays different than its predecessors, and the new direction is one worth rallying behind.",1
"507","It may not end up being the best shooter of 2012, but it could very well be the one that makes you feel the most powerful.",1
"508","Miasmata is unlike anything I've played. It makes the very act of survival an intense learning experience, and manages to do so without beating you over the head with lengthy tutorials.",1
"509","A major step up from the PSP versions. It's nearly the same game as the console. The touchscreen controls are a nice addition. It's a smaller, slightly less polished version of the game, but still an awesome baseball experience, and one of the best portable sports games ever.",1
"510","Grumbles about the frustrating matchmaker aside, Super Monday Night Combat is a free-to-play game that would have been a perfectly legitimate retail release with a few more maps and available Pros.",1
"511","Dear Esther is that rarest of things: a truly interesting game. It left me feeling pensive, mildly saddened, and confident that games have plenty of directions left to explore. If you're interested in what can be achieved when you abandon the conventions of games and explore the fringes of the form instead, it's a must-play.",1
"512","It's the right length to keep from feeling too repetitive, though I'd still have enjoyed it a lot more if the types of tasks I had to do had evolved in ways beyond cut, push, pull, repeat, or if the story had been more heavily implemented.",1
"513","The Wii U drops the physics, but it adds some nifty GamePad functionality. Nintendo's version could run smoother, though.",1
"514","The game's infectious spirit and sense of humour is irresistible, and it's big, too – you're not beating this one in a weekend. It's just a shame that putting stickers at the heart of the game didn't turn out to be the master-stroke it so readily could have been.",1
"515","It doesn't reach the near perfect balance between character-driven story and tense gameplay that past pieces of DLC have, but it does tell a story that changes the Mass Effect universe forever.",1
"516","It starts off slow – too slow – but if you give it time and work with it, A New Beginning may become one of your favorite installments in this series so far.",1
"517","If you don't let yourself get too tripped up by the sometimes convoluted combat controls, then this charming, well-crafted platforming bloodfeast will really sink its fangs into you -- in a good way.",1
"518","By rights, Alan Wake's American Nightmare should be utterly underwhelming. The core game is changed not at all from its parent's lukewarm style, the story is thin and hackneyed, hell it even has live-action cutscenes. But somehow, the gameplay is challenging enough to keep you clicking that left mouse button and listening to that weird, not quite Rod Serling voice telling you to survive until morning just one more time.",1
"519","It's a solid gateway expansion that builds on the rules without overwhelming you, but still adds enough variety that you'll never want to play without it.",1
"520","If you weren't crazy about Ninja Gaiden the last three times, this is the same game, so keep walking. Likewise if you already played either Black or Sigma, you're probably ok to hold off, too. But for those of you that only played the 2004 original, or missed the game entirely, you've now got a beefed up, extra content edition that you can play anywhere. That's worth flipping out and killing dudes over.",1
"521","Unit 13 doesn't have flashy visuals or an in-depth campaign, but it does have good controls and plenty to do. I think the AI could use a tune-up and the visuals some polish, but if you're looking for a game to sink bullet after bullet into, Unit 13 will keep you entertained.",1
"522","For an adventure absolutely beaming with personality and potential, the gameplay experience wasn't quite as fine as I would have liked, but it doesn't make Escape Plan anything less than a great game in its own right. It's just unfortunate, because it could have been more with slightly better execution.",1
"523","The lack of depth does wear thin over the long-haul after you've played a bunch of match to their conclusion, but you may find yourself reluctant to let go until you've fully experienced into each faction's magical might.",1
"524","It's a shame that humdrum maps and a poor matchmaking setup occasionally sours the promising designs of each class' special abilities, but when it works, few free-to-play shooters grant such a memorable and thoroughly entertaining experience.",1
"525","It's far from perfect and best viewed with ""launch goggles"" on, but Razor's Edge's unflinching action and unabashed violence is a great sign for the Wii U as a core gamer's platform.",1
"526","Oftentimes the redo reflects the exact standards and formulas of its new genre rather than marching boldly into new territory. Syndicate falls into this trap, telling a boring tale of swapping allegiances amidst flurries of gunfire.",1
"527","Though it has some pacing issues and a seemingly useless upgrade system, the funny, meaningful stories had me reading right past them.",1
"528","It's good, stupid fun no matter which side you play on, although a questionable option to switch sides midmatch occasionally leaves too many players stacked on the dino side.",1
"529","It works as both a cathartically satisfying hack-and-slash on the easier difficulties, and a surprisingly thoughtful action-based strategy game on the higher levels.",1
"530","A great blend of tower defense and action with loads of personality and a cool hook.",1
"531","The only notable feature unique to the PC version of Choplifter HD is its spotty mouse controls. I preferred the precision of an Xbox game pad to my mouse, as the aiming is not only tuned better for it, but circular within the game as well. My mouse aiming was jittery and unreliable, which made hairy situations impossible.",1
"532","Tekken 3D Prime Edition definitely gets props for recreating the fast combat and fluidity of the series on a handheld. However, the lack of any real depth in the modes and lack of customization features for your fighters makes it tough to want to spend an extended amount of time with it.",1
"533","StarDrone Extreme may not assail your senses or do anything entirely new and exciting, but hell if it isn't fun for what it is.",1
"534","Doom 3 is a very good game, probably better than you remember. For PS3 owners who've never gotten any of this content, it's a particularly great deal. BFG Edition is a tough sell for the PC crowd.",1
"535","The high definition resolution makes it the best-looking of all the versions, but the models and textures are all the same here – much more could be done on Wii U, and hopefully a future Transformers release will be able to actually take advantage of the new system's power.",1
"536","Deus Ex Human Revolution - Director’s Cut had an unenviable task: take one of 2011’s best games and make it even better, all while figuring out how to best utilize the oft-ignored GamePad. It succeeded on all fronts.",1
"537","Velocity Ultra doesn't have screen-clearing super weapons or massive, three-stage boss fights like a lot of its vertically scrolling cousins do. But with its clever teleporting trick, it does something completely different from most of them and it does it extremely well.",1
"538","On face value there are fewer drastic improvements, but many gentle refinements to the UI and subtle additions to its newer formulas mean that Football Manager 2014 improves solidly where it counts.",1
"539","If not for the confusing fake 3D effect, Mutant Mudds Deluxe would be the definitive version of Renegade Kid’s 2D platformer, with the same tight gameplay, charming graphics, and chirpy soundtrack bolstered by more levels than ever before.",1
"540","The fact that it’s built around something as simple as completing a map makes it accessible, but there are systems within – specifically when it comes to combat -- that make it dynamic and deep.",1
"541","Last Light’s setting and presentation are its strong points, though the last third of its 10-hour campaign is weaker than everything that came before it.",1
"542","Well-designed maps, two dramatically different sides in the Americans and Japanese, and authentic feeling weapons make Red Orchestra 2: Rising Storm an excellent and unique-feeling first-person shooter.",1
"543","As far as a first episode goes, Kentucky Route Zero establishes the setting, tone and characters better than I could have expected. I love that I'm still thinking about what exactly happened to Conway and company, and that intrigue has left me longing for the next piece of the tale.",1
"544","It's an uneven experience, but occasionally it grasps greatness, making it a worthy addition to an already distinguished series.",1
"545","Blood Dragon is a different beast – and it’s something you shouldn’t miss.",1
"546","A well-curated car list, a great sense of speed, and a well-thought out career mode combine in a racer that is a lot of fun to play through.",1
"547","Annoying design choices and forced moments of repetition have a bad habit of spoiling the mood, but between them is an experience that's scary as all hell.",1
"548","Story mode is a pleasant surprise, but the real reason to play is the thrill of harnessing the god-like powers of some of the most overwhelming figures in the comic realm.",1
"549","The Knife of Dunwall is satisfying to play, but fails to build much momentum in its story.",1
"550","Play the original first (it’s cheap) but Company of Heroes 2 satisfied my appetite for more.",1
"551","It’s best to think of Need for Speed: Rivals as a thrill ride. Get on, scream, plead to go faster, and it will.",1
"552","Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes becomes a stronger game by weakening its hero characters.",1
"553","Undercover’s story is an incredibly entertaining homage to countless movies and television shows, and manages to feature a very strong cast of characters – no small feat considering the game has no major license associated with it.",1
"554","It successfully borrows from table-top gaming and history itself to create a simulation that, more than most strategy titles, feels like war.",1
"555","Smoothed-out, cleaned-up visuals are on by default, though you can do everything from toggling full widescreen to turning on artificial scan lines, simulating the interlacing of the coin-op cabinet’s CRT monitor.",1
"556","Played as intended with a group of friends, PayDay 2 is much like one of its heists: things can get a little sloppy, but the potential payoff is big.",1
"557","Season 2’s premiere of The Walking Dead is predictable in good and bad ways — its character drama is strong, its technical prowess is not.",1
"558","It’s not only Vita’s prettiest game; it’s also a hell of a lot of fun to play. Immersive, stylish, and full of action, Muramasa Rebirth’s twin campaigns, multiple endings, hidden Demon Swords, massive exploration and other optional goodies are enough to keep you busy for a good long while.",1
"559","It may end in frustration, but its worth playing just to see how it masterfully hits all the survival horror notes with its distinct presentation and vicious design.",1
"560","Considering the elegance and sophistication of the world, combat and upgrade design, it’s a shame everything else seems so ho-hum.",1
"561","Mercenary is a truly great shooter, one that was crafted with the hardcore shooter fan in mind. There’s a lot to love here -- even if its campaign is woefully short – from its deep Contracts mode to its engaging multiplayer functionality.",1
"562","Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition captures the essence of what makes fantasy RPGs so beloved.",1
"563","Just be prepared to pack your patience and reign in your expectations of what wearing a crown means. You'll still be toiling in the fields like everybody else, but at least you can do so with a smile on your face.",1
"564","An excellent example of how games can do more with less. Its combat is deceptively simple, there are no character advantages, and the tight, dangerous environments each feel unique. However, the lack of an online multiplayer mode will likely keep it relegated to “great party game” status.",1
"565","Dead Rising 3 doesn’t get by on its looks, but its meaty zombie-slaying combat and nearly endless supply of undead and ridiculous weapons go a long way.",1
"566","Tough but gratifying, F1 2013 is not a startling improvement from the already robust F1 2012, but it’s certainly Codemasters’ best and most confident crack at F1 to date.",1
"567","The addition of its innovative competitive asymmetrical multiplayer is the big draw here – as long as everyone takes the time to learn the complex rules, that is.",1
"568","Eldritch's various components tend to work quite well on their own, and create most of a great Roguelike. But the speed and arbitrary nature of death means that the crazy desperate stories of near-death (or death) that make other games in the genre so memorable are unlikely to occur.",1
"569","This HD version shares all the problems its predecessor has, including noticeably limited enemy variety and weak allied AI that can't hit the broad side of a barn.",1
"570","Soul Sacrifice straddles the line between delivering the depth typically found on console and the on-off-on-again routine of handheld gaming, and the result is something that will likely please Vita owners hungry for a quality, grind-heavy RPG.",1
"571","Toki Tori 2’s incredibly slow pace and lack of any true action make it an experience that is definitely not for everyone - but kids, puzzle lovers, and fans of all things adorable are in for a truly delightful and well-crafted experience.",1
"572","For whatever else Dragon Commander is, it's also a game that puts big issues on the main stage, then lets us reap the rewards and shoulder the consequences of their decisions without moral judgment. For that reason alone, it's worth a look.",1
"573","If you’re on a budget and looking for a portable dungeon crawler with loads of content and personality to spare, it’s hard to get more bang for your buck.",1
"574","I was looking for more explorations, depth, and variety, and in this department Rivals is slightly wanting, though it’s innovative approach to incorporating multiplayer does just enough to compensate.",1
"575","Its high level of difficulty, catchy tunes, and pixelated graphics meld nicely with its emphasis on loot, customization, and online play.",1
"576","There's elegance in ShootMania's simplicity, and it's great and refreshing to see some new ideas brought to a genre that's been largely abandoned by the big-name games. It does, however, lack personality and variety in weaponry.",1
"577","A few cute unlockable cards and tables are nice touches, but ultimately the lack of more modes, multiplayer, or anything else to substantially mix things up doesn’t give this game a lot of legs. Still, for the low ante it costs to pick it up, it’s worth it for the jokes.",1
"578","It has some of the best car chases around, and they’ve never looked so chaotically beautiful as they do on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.",1
"579","MLB 13: The Show on Vita is the Oakland A’s of video game baseball: they play in a crummy stadium (the Vita), but when you look past that, they’re pretty damn good.",1
"580","Next to Arkham City, Arkham Origins is a bit of a disappointment in its lack of new ideas and use of win buttons, making it the least interesting of the trilogy",1
"581","It’s slow, and methodical, and there isn’t a grindable unlock or weapon crate to be found. It attempts to make you think about every step you take and every slight weapon tweak, but the odd hitboxes and frustrating lack of saved loadouts undermines some of the good work.",1
"582","On the current-gen versions I feel like I’m in complete control of everything, from passing to running, and that I can trust both the offensive and defensive line so I can focus on overall strategy. But this new version of Madden 25 meddles with the running game and it screws up the delicate balance between pass and run.",1
"583","If you dig MegaTen (or classic RPGs in general), Soul Hackers is worth a look. Put on some Radiohead and sip an Orbitz to put yourself in a proper '90s mood and enjoy an oldie that still proves to be a goodie.",1
"584","PES 2014 looks better than ever and the gameplay's a lot of fun, but nostalgia stops it from being a huge leap forward.",1
"585","Its single-player campaign suffers from some AI issues and dabbling in non-shooter gameplay it’s just not good at, but it’s still an enjoyable romp that challenges you to really think about how you’re approaching each fight. And then there’s multiplayer, as hardcore as ever but with a level of accessibility that will allow Killzone’s online community to grow and flourish for some time to come.",1
"586","Escape Plan absolutely reeks of nonsense and humor, which is exactly what you'd expect from a team partially comprised of the squad that brought PlayStation Network gamers Fat Princess.",1
"587","Not only is its combat system flashy and well thought out, it's well explained too, thanks to its powerful training tools, and what is easily the most complete guide to terminology and tactics ever assembled in a fighting game.",1
"588","The next-gen versions add more detail pretty much everywhere, but in the end it makes me have to fight for control of my players and worry about little things that aren’t that interesting.",1
"589","Some of the options seem superfluous, and the gym functionality is totally ignorable, but it’s still a fun, effective way to get your sweat on.",1
"590","There’s not a lot here that wasn’t in Just Dance 4, or even Just Dance 3, but the series’ talent for getting people up and dancing is still unmatched.",1
"591","Though its sharp fangs of resource management may have been dulled, in place of the swift bite is a deeper, more haunting world that will linger with me much longer than the original.",1
"592","Cities in Motion 2's more realistic approach may leave it looking a little drabber than its predecessor, but its focus on dynamic cities, timetables, and ticket prices in a contemporary city in real time make it a significant improvement over its predecessor.",1
"593","It’s a clever and challenging way to experience the classics without just retreading old ground.",1
"594","It's a darkly entertaining way to cut, explore, and appreciate the incredible skill of real surgeons.",1
"595","The smaller scale, lopsided balance, and multiplayer lobby screwups may keep it from being mentioned in the same breath as the biggest and best, but being a successful minor power in the pantheon of strategy games is still a fine achievement.",1
"596","Sid Meier’s Ace Patrol combines Firaxis’ storied tactics with fast-paced mission design and a user interface that translates well from touchscreen taps to mouse clicks.",1
"597","A breath of fresh air for both longtime fans of the show and brawlers in general. It’s as interesting outside of its missions as in them, with unique experience-point investing and gambling mechanics that future games in this genre should look to for inspiration.",1
"598","With easy controls and lots of customization options, naval battles in Leviathan: Warships shine in multiplayer but sputter in the stagnant single-player campaign.",1
"599","Project X Zone is often funny and consistently frantic – two traits not necessarily associated with tactical RPGs. Its story is confusing and the chapters slavishly follow the same repetitive formula, but the superb battle system makes repetition not just tolerable, but enjoyable.",1
"600","Backing up that gleeful imagination with a mechanic that encourages good rather than simply energetic play makes for a rare treat that both novice and veteran brawlers can enjoy while it lasts.",1
"601","With its appealing graphics, stable servers, huge aircraft inventory, and no-cost entry fee, World of Warplanes is full of opportunities for dogfighting rookies and veterans alike to enjoy the thrill of the aerial kill.",1
"602","If you think you’d have enough concentration to be able to endure those quirks, though, Concentration Training could very well help you overcome the many distractions in your life.",1
"603","I wish that Blackguards' character progression system wasn't such a mess, because if it worked, I'd be delighted to recommend the entire low-fantasy role-playing package without hesitation.",1
"604","Features the same flaws and polish issues that marred the original, but also has the same addictive combat that leaves you yearning for more.",1
"605","While the inclusion of online play creates some issues with the slower-moving sports, it’s still a fun addition for Tennis and Baseball.",1
"606","One of the weirdest games to ever wear the Nintendo name.",1
"607","Noticeably repetitious levels and bad storytelling can't overshadow the awesome feeling of piloting the Strike Suit, and simulation fans and less-hardcore players alike will find plenty to like in Strike Suit Zero.",1
"608","If you like a challenge and don't mind a grind, you may be able to find out if Fang's stuck-up attitude and selfishness carry him all the way through to getting his revenge.",1
"609","Although Sorcery Saga’s roguelike elements and minor glitches made me feel incredibly frustrated at times, I still enjoyed the story and characters enough to power through its multileveled dungeons just to see what happened once the credits rolled.",1
"610","A surprisingly deep experience with a variety of ways to play. While there are some duds to be found in each mode, there are enough highlights to have fun in plenty of different ways.",1
"611","The lack of notable features of previous games, especially four-player matches, is puzzling and disappointing. Instead of the definitive Dr. Mario experience, Dr. Luigi is an interesting spin of an established classic.",1
"612","The core gameplay, including the variety of suits and weapons, is terrific, and it’s reason enough to play this sci-fi shooter. But the boring story, too-similar missions, and aggressive payment model hold it back from what it could be.",1
"613","Contrast is a game full of heart, beauty, and at least a few excellent puzzles.",1
"614","Some parts of the future are stuck in the past, but it’s strikingly well-balanced, providing solutions for existing problems and new toys to tinker with that counteract each other nicely.",1
"615","It’s at its best when it marries its poignant story to its platforming, and at its weakest when it’s about moving boxes, but it rarely goes very long without showing us something worth playing.",1
"616","A streamlined, easy to understand MOBA for those looking for an entry point to the genre.",1
"617","Much like Portal, The Talos Principle makes you feel smart just by playing it, as the bulk of the puzzles hit that sweet spot between too easy and near-impossible.",1
"618","A blast to play in short bursts... The lackluster presentation, however, hinders the overall experience, making it difficult to play more than a few games per sitting.",1
"619","Adventure mode’s poor pacing and repetition didn’t hold my interest, but King and Pacifism modes are much more interesting – as are the helpful A.I. drones, which provide more than enough reasons to go back and chase those leaderboards.",1
"620","The updated art style proved overwhelming at times, but the winning soundtrack and forgiving save system were always there to encourage me to play through the frustration. In the end, I simply couldn’t put it down.",1
"621","One of the year's most thoughtful games.",1
"622","Feels like a new-gen experience that 2K isn’t quite ready for. It’s an absolutely beautiful game to look at, and its controls are as tight as they’ve ever been. Some features are vastly improved from last year, and fortunately most of those continue to work when the servers don’t. It’s a shame that the best game modes won’t always be accessible, because this could’ve been an amazing basketball game.",1
"623","Little details, like characters turning their heads to look as you pass or flocks of Wingulls flying overhead, make the region really come to life, and small updates and tweaks help make the journey smoother. Still, a few of its flaws are even more glaring in 3D, especially the excess water Pokémon and often dull navigation of their habitats.",1
"624","New 3D maps add depth and ideas to a tried-and-true formula, but they aren’t taken far enough to make this feel like a real sequel.",1
"625","In some ways it’s a step forward, in others a step back - and with Konami’s PES seemingly in resurgent form, EA Sports can’t afford to take its eye off the ball.",1
"626","Plays out on one of the greatest, most beautiful maps in strategy gaming history. It combines style, substance, and setting into a marvelous overall experience for both empire management and tactical combat. It struggles slightly with strategic depth, but this is a science fiction and fantasy strategy game with tremendous soul.",1
"627","Like a great player toughing it out through an injury, NBA 2K15 is still strong despite crippling server problems.",1
"628","It's not a cheery story, but it's one well told and worth at least the three or so hours it takes to appreciate without the sometimes unintuitive puzzles, or as long as they take to solve.",1
"629","Dark Souls 2: Crown of the Sunken King is a brutal, but entertaining opening to a coming trilogy of DLC.",1
"630","FIFA 15 remains one of the most impressively comprehensive sport simulations around, and on new-gen hardware it really is the beautiful game. But while some of FIFA 15’s refinements are worthwhile – and a tangible improvement on FIFA 14 – its flaws stand out all the more.",1
"631","Its fast and easy flow of action and puzzling is easy to recommend.",1
"632","While the omission of leaderboards and StreetPass functionality does make Siesta Fiesta a lonely experience, it’s still a fun, challenging game that deftly blends a variety of retro genres.",1
"633","Sunless Sea gives you a wonderful world to explore and packs it with memorable written vignettes. Its permadeath flirts with repetitiveness, and combat is disappointing, but it’s far from running out of ways to inspire one more trip back across the Unterzee.",1
"634","With an essential early-game choice that makes it worth playing through twice, the story at the center of Wolfenstein: The New Order props up its competent -- but mostly unremarkable -- shooting.",1
"635","Treasure Tracker takes the core concept of Captain Toad and runs wild with it. It’s a smart, adorable puzzle game that presents some awesome locales and really rewards you for taking the time to unpack them. Despite the control issues and menu problems, Captain Toad Treasure Tracker proves that you can still be great without being Super.",1
"636","A clever campaign with hard, meaningful decisions to make at every turn is hindered only by how zealously it insists you live with the consequences of those decisions – even if it means throwing away hours of hard-fought victories because a couple engagements went poorly.",1
"637","Defense Grid 2’s new variations on the original’s excellent tower defense gameplay pulled me right back into the compulsively addictive quest to destroy all aliens with a minimum of expenditure.",1
"638","Beyond Earth is nowhere near the strongest game in the more than 20-year-old Civilization series, but this big collection of interesting experimental ideas definitely still kept me playing long after I should’ve gone to bed.",1
"639","Wasteland 2 might not be the prettiest CRPG to hit digital shelves this year, but it captures the harsh hypothetical realities of the post-apocalyptic American Southwest with excellent writing, decisions with terrifying consequences, and background voice work that reinforce the human suffering that results from them.",1
"640","Car chases aside, Watch Dogs is fundamentally very well made, and has more than enough unique ideas to make it a great and memorable open-world action game.",1
"641","Aside from its problematic ending, Ground Zeroes mostly represents a new, more sophisticated era for Metal Gear, particularly given its attention to what matters on PC.",1
"642","Trials Fusion is at once mercilessly exacting, and regularly thrilling. It allows you to exert an impressive level of control over your rider, and leverages that control to create nuanced, challenging tracks that beg to be run, and re-run until perfection is attained.",1
"643","It was refreshing to experience something truly different, even in the well-worn territory of the old-school. I was especially impressed by its dedication to its strange and novel mechanic, one that makes it so much more than yet another retro-inspired side-scroller.",1
"644","Trials Fusion is at once mercilessly exacting, and regularly thrilling.",1
"645","Its nature as a side-story to the HBO show means we won’t get to decide the fate of Westeros, but this introduction is convincing evidence that the future of House Forrester puts enough at stake to make choices matter.",1
"646","The Sly Collection succeeds where many before it have failed: it brings a classic console platforming series to the Vita with no crippling side effects. Despite some forgivable framerate issues, the enduring charm and intelligence of Sly Cooper’s design stole my heart once again.",1
"647","While the few new mechanics that Pushmo World introduces are never fully utilized and a number of its puzzles feel a bit too familiar, the streamlined ability to create and share custom puzzles promises a virtually never-ending stream of new content to conquer.",1
"648","With an essential early-game choice that makes it worth playing through twice, the story at the center of Wolfenstein: The New Order props up its competent -- but mostly unremarkable -- shooting.",1
"649","Don’t be fooled by the simplicity of its pixels: no individual element of Dungeon of the Endless is especially complicated, but together they form a fiendish and unforgiving challenge.",1
"650","It sacrifices some of both series’ challenge, and the alternate-universe story feels like a missed opportunity where there could have been more meaningful interaction between the worlds of Wright and Layton.",1
"651","The later levels lose some of the over-the-top fun of the earlier ones, but overall, Trials Fusion offers a fun, deeply challenging experience with lots to see and do.",1
"652","OlliOlli only does one thing, but it does it with style and grace. The trick system, while initially off-putting, strikes a near perfect balance of technique, creativity, and precision without coming off as overwhelming or obtuse.",1
"653","All of this, peppered into in-game and pre-rendered cutscenes, makes The New Order feel surprisingly human, and your situation quite desperate.",1
"654","Defense Grid 2 is just as addictive as 2008's Defense Grid: Awakening, but lacks the original's surprising heart.",1
"655","At times it becomes a mind-numbing slog, as you're reduced to performing the same rote set of actions for hours until you perfect the one jump or dodge that's holding you back. The reward is a sense of mastery, but the price can be awfully steep, making this a true test of skill – and patience.",1
"656","While its slightly unbalanced design holds it back from being a genuine classic, it nonetheless does enough right to put a swagger back in Strider’s step for the first time in decades.",1
"657","While I appreciate the world, atmosphere, and mechanics, I can't help but wish that there was a light at the end of Don't Starve's dark and lonely tunnel.",1
"658","The slightly lower resolution is the only noticeable difference between the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of Watch Dogs, and I doubt I’d have picked up on it if I hadn’t just come from playing the PS4 version.",1
"659","For the first time in years, Grid Autosport feels like a Codemasters racing game built to appeal to long-time Codemasters racing fans.",1
"660","The abundance of inventive and genuinely fun characters, and the inclusion of playable villains, means there’s always some amazing new trick to try. The new versions of Skystones and tilting lock puzzles are fun enough that I’d play them by themselves. On the downside, there’s nothing new here for your existing Skylanders, and the overall story just fails to come together.",1
"661","A good game in a great series, but it only gets a qualified recommendation because of its weak naval warfare and its lack of several clever features that distinguish its predecessors.",1
"662","Game of Thrones Ep 1: Iron from Ice is a strong start for Telltale's adventure in George R. R. Martin's fantasy world.",1
"663","Crimes and Punishments offers a huge advance in graphics and gameplay for the Sherlock Holmes adventure series, and is well worth playing for longtime fans -- especially if they’re playing on a new-gen console or PC.",1
"664","There’s not much of a challenge or a reason to revisit once you’ve finished, but the story alone is worth experiencing. Ultimately, it’s a game about warfare that’s more interested in the people and their experiences, than bullets and their targets.",1
"665","With just the right pace, an appropriate level of challenge, and some customization options that make it much more than just another old-school side-scroller, Azure Striker Gunvolt comes heavily recommended to those that want to relive a sliver of the platformer golden era.",1
"666","NEO Scavenger is a deep, exciting sandbox for discovery with some truly surprising and inspired moments of storytelling. Its detailed and gritty survival mechanics bring an edge of realism, but often serve as a daunting barrier to some of the best parts of the story.",1
"667","This reimagining of the original Strider establishes developer Double Helix’s firm grasp on the essence of the joy of movement that makes Strider Hiryu such a great character.",1
"668","It’s a complex production that boils down simply to this: Destiny is a mechanically excellent, visually evocative FPS housed within an under-developed RPG framework. The endgame might hook you for the long haul once you fully understand it, but Destiny is ultimately unable to be all the different games it’s trying so hard to be.",1
"669","It lacks environmental variety and a sense of fairness when it comes to some of the boss battles, but it shows great potential for a revitalized series.",1
"670","Garden Warfare respects its roots by preserving its characters and their humor and skillfully adapting their charm to a third-person shooter...The solid controls, fun modes, and varied map design make it a good shooter to boot.",1
"671","A Big Boss/Snake adventure has never looked or played better, and in it lies incredible promise for its enormous big brother.",1
"672","Despite its tendency to make you jump through hoops before getting to the good stuff, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel delivers where I expect it to as a Borderlands fan.",1
"673","Ground Zeroes is a short but challenging game, and those willing to cast aside conventional expectations will find a lot more here than first glance might suggest.",1
"674","The half-baked nature of Destiny's RPG elements are just a symptom of a far larger issue: This is a game that’s straddling the borders between too many kinds of experiences, and in its attempts to have something for everyone, it never fully satisfies on any one front.",1
"675","Tough decisions, well-acted original characters in interesting situations, and a strong, provocative ending kick off Telltale’s new Game of Thrones series in a great way.",1
"676","Dead Nation on PlayStation 4 is just as great as it is on PlayStation 3. It's still eerie, difficult, and a ton of fun to play, whether online with your friends or on your own in a dimly-lit room.",1
"677","Navigation is iffy, and the healing system is a bit broken even after a major revision, but its humor and personality shine through to make this a good Halloween bounty.",1
"678","The cases are thoroughly enjoyable, but deducing the murderer can be nebulous and unsatisfying due to a preponderance of circumstantial evidence.",1
"679","Learning the obtuse and complicated systems is surprisingly enjoyable, because you’ll see satisfying results instantly when you conquer a problem.",1
"680","It turns out that better games don't necessarily make for better remixes.",1
"681","Though the pacing is sluggish and some of the quests a little too redundant, the kooky characters, silly humor, and incredibly addictive gameplay kept me fishing and forging well after the final credits rolled.",1
"682","There's constantly a hook that keeps me coming back for more, even if it means sitting through another chunk of tedious story.",1
"683","Hack N’Slash is both a perfect pun and an amazingly clever game; one that does have a tendency to get so wrapped up in being clever that the gameplay suffers for it, unless you and its creators are on the exact same wavelength, but which does at least let you feel smart as well.",1
"684","The developers – aptly named Ragequit – focused on the big picture, which is wonderfully captured dogfights between megabots, but they've neglected to tie all its complex pieces together with a useful tutorial.",1
"685","As a pure city-building game, Banished is dazzling. It combines simple charms with transparent, complex systemic interactions, and a tough-but-fair difficulty curve.",1
"686","Infamous: First Light is a decent story around a better character than Second Son, but its battles don’t have the same scale or superpower variety that Second Son’s do. After the short campaign, its challenge maps put a new spin on combat by taking away your ability to escape danger on a whim, making it much tougher.",1
"687","The real treasure in Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris wasn't Lara’s story, bipedal alligator warriors, or a bounty of gems, but solving complex and varied environmental puzzles with friends.",1
"688","MouseCraft is a thoughtful puzzle game with challenging levels and some clever features. While customizable controls and a little more information on the level-select screen would have removed some significant annoyances, the overall enjoyment of easily being able to drop in to any level (including some I made myself) and guide my mice to their prize is good fun.",1
"689","Mighty Gunvolt is short, but sweet. It's not incredibly difficult, but it's not necessarily meant to be, either. It's an experience more than a full-fledged game, a taste of what Inti Creates is capable of when they strip everything away and go back to the 8-bit style and aesthetic they proved to know so much about when creating Mega Man 9 and 10.",1
"690","The scope is stunning, the customization is satisfying, and the multiplayer touches upon some really ambitious ideas. But the lack of a strong main character or interesting take on the Assassin’s Creed universe costs it momentum and excitement, and the persistent control problems are still a thorn in its side.",1
"691","MouseCraft is a thoughtful puzzle game with challenging levels and some clever features.

"692","Nintendo gets a lot out of mileage out of this Sims-like concept, but still manages to find ways to make it simple, accessible, and entertaining.",1
"693","Its strong character progression and combat systems better suit the offline Elder Scrolls games than in most MMOs, but it’s very much a game about adventuring with other players.",1
"694","That said, the tentacles of Driveclub can grip tight if you get invested in the game’s asynchronous challenges, and it’s very much geared around encouraging us to hop online and compete by making it so easy.",1
"695","The skeleton-shattering, long-distance kills are still its riveting centerpiece, of course, but even without the element of dumb fun they offer, Sniper Elite III would still be a smart, unexpectedly memorable experience.",1
"696","The PC version of Unity requires a pretty hefty rig to run, and an even heftier one is recommended. That said, those of you who have access to this will find that Unity on PC looks even better than its console brethren thanks to being able to run at resolutions above 900p, enhanced textures, and (hardware permitting) a much higher frame rate than the locked 30fps of the Xbox One and PS4.",1
"697","Better and more focused than its precursor. The slow, calculated multiplayer matches afford plenty of opportunity for strategic fun, though the single-player mode is more a tutorial than a substantial component.",1
"698","The same great game it is on Xbox One, but prettier. On the other side of that coin, it includes the same issues with the map design feeling maze-like and confusing, but no other game does huge hordes of zombies quite like this one.",1
"699","Though its overeagerness to hand out points and make everyone feel like a winner robs it of some competitive value, Just Dance 2015 just works as a fun, get-up-and-move game, with a wink and smile along the way.",1
"700","It’s a good start to what may eventually be expanded into a great Sims game, but it’s not there yet.",1

"702","Filled with interesting ideas, Murasaki Baby's dazzling animation and unique approach to platforming are enticing.",1
"703","Young Horses has done an excellent job taking the diamond in the rough that was the original Octodad student project and turning it into a short but charmingly absurdist physics game.",1
"704","A few weird design choices in regards to the health system and navigation meant that just a bit too much of that time was spent backtracking and squinting at a map, but its humor and personality shine through to make this a good Halloween bounty.",1
"705","Dead Nation on PS Vita isn't as strong as it is on PS3 and PS4, but it's still a lot of fun to play. It's eerie and difficult, whether online with a friend or on your own in a dimly-lit room.",1
"706","Sniper Elite III's open level designs and objectives pack in more than enough variety and stealthy tension to counterbalance its thin story and shaky enemy intelligence, and experimenting with its explosive traps is almost as fun as popping skulls with a sniper rifle.",1
"707","It’s true that this surprisingly feature-packed portable effort does have a few issues - the small text and fiddly touch controls being the main offenders - but the core experience of tactical battles, financial and man management remains as addictive as ever.",1
"708","Mystery of the Mooil Rig may end too quickly, but you'll enjoy the ride.",1
"709","Playing as a diver or a shark is a fast, fun, and frantic experience, and each has its own feel and set of skills.",1
"710","Yoshi’s New Island’s inconsistent art and tacked-on new ideas are all layered on top of the same strong platforming and level design that made the original great. This deep understanding of pacing and flow helps Yoshi’s latest adventure stand out as the best iteration on Yoshi since the SNES original. Even if I wanted to play with the sound turned off.",1
"711","It's unpretentious and straight-forward in its delivery, and yet, underneath its façade rests an addictive top-down shooter with solid mechanics and a hardcore slant.",1
"712","By utilizing time and resource management, inside claustrophobic and violent situations, it builds tension and instills panic like very few games.",1
"713","As a stealth game, Sir, You Are Being Hunted is a refreshingly different and unscripted approach with a haunting but still light-hearted atmosphere.",1
"714","Goat Simulator isn’t much of a game, but it’s a hell of a good time. The small but dense map is packed with tons of jokes and bugs that should be seen rather than talked about, and there’s at least a few hours’ worth of entertainment in goofing around with the jetpack alone.",1
"715","Continue?9876543210 is arty game that actually attempts to challenge us, yet their short, repetitive, ritualistic nature can interrupt the themes that make this a unique and interesting game.",1
"716","A dense, intriguing, but ultimately safe expansion, The Old Hunters is more of the same brutal Bloodborne experience.",1
"717","Its universe keeps getting harder and harder to take seriously, and its microtransactions are borderline gross, but Mortal Kombat X is a great fighting game all the same.",1
"718","Rocket League is a rare example where the execution of a simple, absurd idea is so strong and so engaging that it doesn’t need a ton of extra features around it.",1
"719","Despite unreliable servers, Rocket League is a fast, fluid, absurdly good time with surprising mechanical depth.",1

"726","Gears' strong style and great gameplay make it enjoyable even today, nine years after the original was released.",1
"727","With its biggest rival matching its dynamism and beating it for fluidity and responsiveness, EA Sports has work to do if FIFA is to regain its title as king of the digital sport.",1
"728","The fact that it collects every piece of DLC for both games, the majority of which is of very high quality, plus the fact that you can carry your last-gen saves and characters over, makes it a good pickup for returning fans and a great pickup for new ones.",1
"729","This tale is funny, beautiful, and challenging enough to make up for a few plodding quests and frequent load screens, and it maintains its personality from start to finish, sprinkling the first episode of its story with happy highs and tragic lows.",1
"730","Progressively mastering its wonderful controls and unlocking new upgrades had me totally hooked, and even though its idea of mission variety is something of an illusion, its smart, playful personality kept me too entertained to care.",1
"731","Resident Evil relies on atmosphere, tough limitations, and danger creeping around all corners, and this port recaptures the formula of a classic, relentless survival-horror game.",1
"732","Some of the older visual flaws detract from the experience and pulled me out of tense moments, but the gameplay hooked me right back in.",1
"733","What it lacks in new features it makes up for in improving old ones, such as a better experiences in the Matrix as well as improved interface options.",1
"734","Nintendo’s take on the third-person shooter is refreshingly original, but it needs more modes and content.",1
"735","Tearaway Unfolded is a big and bold adaptation, but lacks some of the original's intimate charm.",1
"736","The people at the center of this story are so engaging that I’m starting to outright ignore awkward dialogue, because the emotional gravity of its storytelling is so much stronger than the irregular out-of-place line or questionable dialogue delivery.",1
"737","A grueling, rewarding racer. The temptation to chuck a controller across the room after instantly jumping from first to last will likely strike a handful of times, and it's a bit thin on customization options, but when all of its high notes line up, Fast Racing Neo is an exhilarating, devilishly grueling game that absolutely pulses with energy.",1
"738","The new guitar makes a tangible improvement to how you experience each and every riff and lick, and GHTV provides an almost irresistible service for enjoying tracks you love while discovering new ones, with absolutely nothing hidden behind a paywall.",1
"739","Adding three different and fun vehicles and extremely creative level designs to the series’ simple but reliably enjoyable action platforming gives Skylanders SuperChargers a healthy boost.",1

"742","All these adjustments to animation, dribbling, and shooting lead to what EA is calling Moments of Magic, which feels like a misguided attempt to define something that’sbeen part of FIFA for years.",1
"743","Volume may suffer from a few issues of poorly designed AI and easily exploited level design, but I still found a great number of challenging rooms with an intriguing story to match, and plenty of room to master.",1
"744","Environmental puzzles function similarly, and are bigger and more involved than in previous episodes.",1
"745","While the puzzles that required physically moving the pieces became tedious, the act of exploring dozens of locations based on things I’ve adored since my childhood was genuinely entertaining.",1
"746","Minor quibbles aside, The Handsome Collection is a great package for any console-bound Borderlands fan.",1
"747","There's a lot to enjoy here, and for newer players who need a little early help, (or for turtlers who prefer to hold on to what they have), the British Forces are a godsend.",1
"748","Dishonored Definitive Edition doesn’t live up to its name, but the core game and its DLC are still stylish and fun.",1
"749","It still suffers technical problems with online play, which is a shame, because outside of noticeably repetitious play-by-play calling and some non-gameplay-affecting framerate issues in cutscenes and replays, NHL 16 is an otherwise excellent game.",1
"750","It might not look like much, but BoxBoy is one of the cleverest puzzle platformers I’ve ever played.",1
"751","Chaos Theory doesn’t bring many major moral choices to the table, but it doesn’t matter – Max’s evolving time-travel power is growing into something bigger and scarier than she ever expected.",1
"752","Guitar Hero Live might not return the series to the heights of its heyday, but it’s definitely the freshest and boldest Guitar Hero game in a very long time.",1
"753","Full of humor, heart, and beauty, King's Quest is a admirable revival of classic adventure games.",1
"754","Attila is an adept refinement of Rome 2. From the desperately paced campaign map down to each individual skirmish on the ash-specked earth, it’s a cleaner, better thought-out experience.",1
"755","A marvelously creative, puzzling adventure that’s very mad at you.",1
"756","Despite very minor frame rate dips and the occasional glitchy element, the beauty and wonder of Jotun unfolds like a storybook and deserves attention.",1
"757","Until Dawn is a flawed, but fun experience. Though an unfocused story means it falls short of greatness, it’s an otherwise entertaining homage to the curious traditions of horror movies which pays off your in-game decisions with occasionally shocking consequences.",1
"758","Its under-developed single-player and franchise management options leave a lot of points on the field, but they can be safely ignored once you get your bearings as a coach and can join the intense competition online.",1
"759","My time with Siege leaves me feeling like this Rainbow Six revival is a skeleton with not a lot of meat on its bones.",1
"760","When played by yourself or with a friend on the couch, NHL 16 is a fast, sharp-looking, and fun hockey sim that (unlike last year’s game) includes enough modes to keep veterans happy while doing an admirable job of welcoming newcomers as well. It still suffers technical problems with online play.",1
"761","Best of all, Syndicate asks you to take London back in a way puts the last few games to shame.",1
"762","Expect vagueness, under-explanation, and frustration at the start, but perseverance is rewarded with sci-fi warfare on a scale you'll see in few other shooters.",1
"763","A beautiful, heart-breaking journey into the end of the world.",1
"764","The Elder Scrolls Online: TU's combat handles well on a gamepad, making it a great way to experience all this content.",1
"765","With the right composition of friends holding controllers, IDARB becomes a ridiculous, intense sports game that is much smarter and more technical than its silly presentation may lead you to believe.",1
"766","A lot is packed into this eventful two-hour episode of Telltale’s Game of Thrones.",1
"767","Transformers Devastation’s nostalgia-fueled fisticuffs are a fun way to revisit the classic TV show.",1
"768","Grey Goo is likely the best traditional RTS not made by Blizzard in the past five years. The cinematic, exciting presentation of the campaign is a big selling point by itself, even if the mission structure and actual scenarios are less than revolutionary.",1
"769","Major developments and long-awaited action push Telltale’s Game of Thrones: Episode 4 - Sons of Winter into position as the best episode yet.",1
"770","Persona 4: Dancing All Night highlights the wonderful music from the Persona series while building a solid story.",1
"771","Looking at Dishonored today, there are elements of the design that haven’t aged gracefully, such as the tendency for mission design to be compartmentalised and the somewhat quirky controls, but the gameplay is still a liberating experience, as it’s grounded in player choice.",1
"772","It’s one of the most thought-provoking and ultimately disarming interactive experiences I’ve had all year, and one I won’t easily shake off.",1
"773","The most fun I’ve had with an Assassin’s game since Black Flag. In fact, I liked it more. Apart from its ill-fitting conclusion, it never takes itself too seriously and delights in the rich possibilities of its Victorian setting and great new grapple gun.",1
"774","There’s certainly no shortage of things to do in Skylanders SuperChargers, and everything you can do is highly polished, however simple it all might be.",1
"775","Blood Bowl 2 is a smashy, satisfying, irreverent combat-sports melee that leaves just a bit too much of the outcome up to the six-sided dice.",1
"776","The representation of the music is just so much more alive than it was before – these courses absolutely buzz with life and energy.",1
"777","Story of Seasons’ kept me occupied for well over 30 hours, and even then I could have kept playing until the cows came home.",1
"778","Sure, the story is dull, and there aren’t a whole lot of original ideas at play here, but the vast expanse of the adventure should please anyone who missed out on it the first time around.",1
"779","The action, humor, and drama are all improved, and Story Mode continues to use Minecraft elements like mob grinders and Endermen to great effect. More improvements need to be made for Story Mode to be considered one of Telltale’s greats, but for now it is moving in the right direction.",1
"780","While it's not as deep as it first appears, fun and fast naval-style combat and a vast explorable galaxy made me want to try out each of its different styles of captaining, and kept me happily blasting away.",1
"781","Aside from awkward performances and a poor original score, Battlefront is a master class in aesthetic authenticity. Beyond a few essential modes built for casual competition, however, Battlefront is unfocused, relying on excess game types to compensate for an absent single-player campaign.",1
"782","Sophisticated combo-based combat delivers a fast and furious barrage of action, but the gear and perks systems left me wondering why they were there at all in a game all about over-the-top boss fights and robot dinosaur beatdowns.",1
"783","Despite uninspiring environmental design, stakes are getting higher, enemies are tougher, and co-operative play is more essential. Now that’s more like it.",1
"784","Titan Souls’ sparse world and lore is merely the delivery device for its creative fights that hinge on your perception and skillful mastery of its simple, yet fluid and responsive controls. Though the experience is short, it’s potent, as weathering every titan’s impossibly lethal storm and finding that one true strike is an excellent and intoxicating retelling of David versus Goliath each time.",1
"785","Despite not having much to do outside of the campaign new defense missions, exploring the Valley of the Yetis is good fun - both as the hunter and as the hunted.",1
"786","Just Cause 3 is a playground where you get to be a physics-defying force of destruction, and its loop of liberating dozens of towns across this enormous scenic world would’ve gotten old much quicker if the combat wasn’t so full of options for free-form mayhem. Getting the most out of it requires some creativity and tolerance for performance bugs on your part, so come expecting to make at least some of your own fun.",1
"787","With elegant simplicity and an eye for charming detail, it got its hooks into me early on, and I embraced the challenge of unraveling the mystery of how its systems worked.",1
"788","Despite the barbed wire and reinforced walls that Rainbow Six Siege makes you walk through in order to get to the meat of the gameplay, I can’t stop thinking about how much fun that gameplay is.",1
"789","Daedalic effectively removed the elements that made last year's release annoying at all the wrong moments, and left its players with the best parts of the experience. It's still a methodical, almost plodding tactical roleplaying game, but now it's easier to find the fun and to enjoy its world and characters.",1
"790","Its campaign is both a great shooter and a great stealth game, and its typical plot is spiced with interesting characters and sparse but punctual humor. The large-scale tactical multiplayer combat the series is known for is still as good as it’s ever been, but the speedy new Hotwire and round-based 5v5 modes provide both speed and thrills.",1
"791","A delightfully charming and unique platformer. Its world is varied, its challenge is high, and the hand-molded look and feel make for a remarkable journey.",1
"792","There’s plenty of content in both, and I’ll be back for more Mario, at least.",1
"793","Judgement gallops along at a great pace, and ends once again on a very curious cliffhanger.",1
"794","Aside from awkward performances and a poor original score, Battlefront is a master class in aesthetic authenticity. Beyond a few essential modes built for casual competition, however, Battlefront is unfocused, relying on excess game types to compensate for an absent single-player campaign.",1
"795","Refreshingly different.",1
"796","Dating birds may seem silly, but Hatoful Boyfriend nails its plot with the help of its well-written characters, and even surpasses its humorous premise with mysterious themes and dark undertones.",1
"797","Type-0’s gritty tone, fast-paced action, and strategic approach to time management is a welcome change of pace from the usual Final Fantasy experience. Though an exasperating camera and clunky mission controls sometimes dampened my fun, I enjoyed meeting the Class Zero cadets and guiding them through battle. There’s definitely no other class quite like them.",1
"798","It may have linear dungeons and a less-than-stellar story, but it’s open-world exploration, enjoyable customization, and flashy new Armitization feature are enough for it to stand on its own.",1
"799","Aside from awkward performances and a poor original score, Battlefront is a master class in aesthetic authenticity. Beyond a few essential modes built for casual competition, however, Battlefront is unfocused, relying on excess game types to compensate for an absent single-player campaign.",1
"800","With more exciting combat, Zombi might have been a must-own for horror fans. As it stands, it’s a fun game that does most things right, but constantly reminds you of its biggest flaw.",1
"801","Seeing the series' iconic moments recreated with cute figurines is a treat, and each of the four campaigns is fast-paced enough that completing the entire franchise in its brick-based form will only take roughly seven to eight hours, which is not much longer than the combined film running times (and amounts to brisk mini-campaigns of two hours or less each).",1
"802","Type-0’s gritty tone, fast-paced action, and strategic approach to time management is a welcome change of pace from the usual Final Fantasy experience.

"803","Darksiders 2: Deathinitive Edition brings the original’s diverse world, interesting dungeons, and great loot system to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Sure, the story is dull, and there aren’t a whole lot of original ideas at play here, but the vast expanse of the adventure should please anyone who missed out on it the first time around.",1
"804","Though it momentarily made me want to commit crimes against my controller at certain points when playing alone, Magicka 2’s one-of-a-kind magic system made it difficult to stay mad for very long.",1
"805","The most astonishing thing about Hardline’s multiplayer is how successful it is in trying to please everyone.",1
"806","It’s mildly disappointing to see the framerate capped, and that bots are still in the same state after all this time, but Payday 2’s deep mechanics and purity of vision still make it one of the best, yet most overlooked multiplayer games you can play today.",1
"807","It’s a clever game that’s not afraid to be challenging, and a very enjoyable puzzle if you don’t mind it also being a touch vague, often repetitive, and happy to quickly get as hard as figuring out an actual prison break.",1
"808","Although career mode suffers from uneven difficulty and some situational camera issues, I happily replayed levels to improve my score sheet and climb the leaderboard, or just endlessly tinker with the Sandbox mode.",1
"809","Code Name STEAM is a strange hybrid of turn-based tactics and action, but its simple mechanics create plenty of head-scratching decisions in single or multiplayer.",1
"810","Though it may occasionally test your patience, Magicka 2's charm and depth make it a really fun co-op experience.",1
"811","It’s a conflicting place of despair, a personal playground of explosive action and compulsive, unending progression that I can’t wait to get back to, and one hell of a ride.",1
"812","One nice little surprise that draws on many sources of inspiration, but still manages to stand out for its own virtues.",1
"813","Rise of Incarnates' great fighting action depends heavily on teamwork - when you bring a friend, it shines.",1
"814","Happy Home Designer gets pretty much everything right when it comes to decorating, encouraging creativity, and exploring different styles.",1
"815","Taken slowly, Sunset is a beautiful, fascinating experience.",1
"816","Saints Row IV is just as much silly, largely challenge-free fun in Re-Elected as it was originally, even if it doesn't look as impressive as other recent remasters.",1
"817","Though it doesn’t exactly put the added power of the PS4 and Xbox One to full use, Payday 2: Crimewave Edition is the best-looking console version of Payday 2 you can get, and the best value on any platform for obtaining its wealth of downloadable content.",1
"818","A pleasant surprise in a crowded platforming field. The obstacles present--portals, bounce pads, zip ramps--have all been seen before, but their implementation is anything but stale.",1
"819","Interestingly, Gat Out of Hell doesn't really feature traditional story missions. Instead, it tasks you with completing handfuls of side activities for its condemned supporting characters, and triggers cutscenes once you've finished a certain number of them. It's an odd, somewhat repetitive approach, although making side tasks key to story progression does make them feel a lot more worthwhile.",1
"820","The new weapons, including a minigun-equipped armchair and the Ark of the Covenant – which uses enemies as ammo – are a blast for mowing down guardian demons.",1
"821","Despite a lackluster story and some unnecessary new obstacles, its large playable area and unique underground locations give you lots of opportunities to use its explosive new weaponry, hone your stealth or combat skills or simply experience more of what you enjoyed about Unity’s original release.",1
"822","Even if you don’t have a PSVR, Rez Infinite is still the most complete version of an imaginative cult classic with deceptively nuanced gameplay, but if you do, it’s also an impressive glimpse into the transportive power of virtual reality.",1
"823","Though it’s missing cross-platform play here, its totally deserved success to-date ensures that matchmaking lobbies are still filled with players.",1
"824","Hits the core tenants of what makes this series great. Great gear drives the lust for the hunt even on the small scale, but the big, spectacular fights ultimately matter the most. Generations’ tweaked combat adds just the right tools to make slaying epic boss monsters a fun activity that’s just as fun online or off.",1
"825","Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun’s uncommon attentiveness to characters and story elevate what is already a really entertaining and mentally stimulating quest across 17th-Century Japan. The near-constant annoyance of the camera definitely hindered my feeling of being a zen ninja assassin. Overall though, developer Mimimi has put together one of the most punishing and clever top-down stealth games I’ve ever skulked through.",1
"826","For my money, PES is still ahead where it counts most, but The Journey gives FIFA something unique and rewarding. If you can afford it, this year it might just be worth getting both.",1
"827","For all that FIFA promises something for every football fan, from the casual observer to the full-kit fanatic, I still find myself wishing that EA Sports would spend a little more time focusing on the basics. You could probably create the perfect football game by letting Konami handle everything on the pitch, with EA Sports responsible for everything off it. But FIFA plays well enough that the gains elsewhere – in terms of licensing, authenticity, and big-match atmosphere – more than compensate for those shortcomings.",1
"828","If you intend to play one of these fascinating and fun adventures for the first time or the tenth, the BioShock Collection is the best way to go about it.",1
"829","Hyper Light Drifter is a gorgeous, fast, fluid trek in a neon apocalypse that's hindered by its wordless storytelling.",1
"830","As a veteran returning to play through the three games of BioShock: The Collection is a pleasure, but it’s a bit disappointing to watch the updates and behind-the-scenes content to each entry gradually decline. The original BioShock receives the greatest overhaul and flourishes with new textures and lighting that bring it almost up to modern standards, and a Ken Levine retrospective, while BioShock Infinite is essentially the PC version.",1
"831","Superhot has unique and addictive time-bending puzzles, but it lacks variety and is and very cheesy.",1
"832","There's also some appeal here if you've played before and want to relive Skyrim with the current generation systems, but you'll be best served by picking up the Xbox One version over the PS4 because of superior mod support. However, there’s no new content on the disc to entice you back if you’ve already played all the DLC, only a new coat of paint.",1
"833","If you’ve never experienced Skyrim, the Special Edition is certainly an adventure you can’t afford to miss. It still includes many of the original version’s bugs, ugly character models, and weak combat animations, but the memorable world benefits hugely from improved lighting and effects.",1
"834","Plants vs Zombies Garden Warfare 2 is a great online shooter with an unexpected wealth of single-player stuff, too.",1
"835","Planet Robobot may not be the most challenging platformer around, but its clever use of robotic destruction combined with gorgeous environmental puzzles and unique bosses make for an entertaining ride. I only wish Kirby’s monstrous mech suit could make proper use of the huge amount of collectibles.",1
"836","The map itself is very good, the atmosphere is excellent, and the hits are challenging. Tricky and more than a little James Bond-esque (the snowed-in private clinic has a real SPECTRE / On Her Majesty’s Secret Service vibe to it), Hokkaido is vintage Hitman at its most creative.",1
"837","You could likely beat Shantae: Half-Genie Hero in a couple of sittings, but the platforming action is so varied, and the levels so explorable, it’s worth playing well beyond that. While it's neither innovative nor high-concept, its hand-drawn look and toe-tapping music successfully channel a joy and enthusiasm that has become far too rare in modern video games.",1
"838","There is so much good here, so much heart - especially in the relationships between Noctis and his sworn brothers. It just comes with some changes and compromises that were, at times, difficult for this long-time Final Fantasy fan to come to grips with.",1
"839","Despite the much-needed visual overhaul, if you spent 100+ hours with the PlayStation original there’s maybe not quite enough in this 3DS update to tempt you back. But if Dragon Quest VII doesn’t always justify the significant length of its journey, anyone looking for some good story content to last them well into the winter months will find a portable RPG that dwarfs most of its console counterparts.",1
"840","Under its attractively bright and cartoony art style, Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2 has a great amount of modes and customization options to enjoy, whether alone against the AI or with online allies and enemies.",1
"841","Tyranny is a memorable RPG that looks great and feels fresh, even while largely working in the confines of the old Infinity Engine style. It's also the rare sprawling RPG that invites you to replay it, as its comparatively short running time and significant changes based on choice greatly change the experience from playthrough to playthrough, and combat is deep enough to last. With Tyranny, the old feels new again.",1
"842","There are a few times when this puzzle-platformer leans too heavily into classic run-and-jump territory it’s not suited for, but when it stays the course, BoxBoxBoy! is a great example of how to do a lot with only a little.",1
"843","It’s like walking through a stunning painting, listening to the idle chatter and revealing talks of (sometimes unnatural-sounding) teenagers.",1
"844","It lacks the depth of the two series it combines, but Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE has strong combat and great style.",1
"845","Especially with a little more context for the New Frontier revealed, Telltale is starting to better lay out all the logs it has to build a cabin. I just hope the rest of the structure is as strong as the foundation.",1
"846","Despite some inconsequential decision-making and visual roughness, the amount of heart, character, and unflinching honesty in 1979 Revolution’s short two-hour tale is impressive. As an Iranian-American myself, it’s incredibly refreshing to not only see this subject matter explored, but done so in a smart and sensitive way that succeeds in educating as much as entertaining.",1
"847","Far Harbor adds a large amount of great quests and content within its gloomy but distinctive island setting. Thanks to some well-written, morally ambiguous characters, its choices are as gray as the weather, and much more interesting. Though the new companion isn’t the strongest and the supposedly ruinous radioactive fog is more annoying than threatening, all of the adventuring and new gear absolutely made it worth my while to return to Fallout 4 for Far Harbor.",1
"848","Although short, Pillars of Eternity: The White March: Part 2 is far more entertaining than the expansion's first half.",1
"849","Dated graphics and dodgy netcode slow King of Fighters XIV down a bit, but it's still a deep, rewarding fighter.",1
"850","Most importantly, the hockey presented on the ice is dynamic and fluid, and it serves up an excellent version of the fastest game around.",1
"851","As a puzzler it has charm due to Yarny’s engaging skills, but as a platforming experience it’s less remarkable. But to judge it solely on these mechanical aspects would be to overlook its greater achievement: the way it provokes subtle and complex emotions through the use of nature and nostalgia. It all makes for a sincere, warm-hearted, and extremely likeable adventure.",1
"852","Although not every part of That Dragon, Cancer works, it’s a crushingly intimate game that left me thankful for the people who are still in my life, and reflective on those who are not. I’m so grateful to the Greens for sharing their experience.",1
"853","Although its clunky controls and inconsistent voice acting dates Heavy Rain, it still remains enjoyable (if mad) B-grade sholock. A stunning visual upgrade on the PlayStation 4 makes this the version to grab if you’re new to developer Quantic Dream’s games, and existing fans should find enjoyment in a richer aesthetic this time around.",1

"855","Offworld Trading Company is fast-paced economic warfare with some clever capitalistic mind games to play with.",1
"856","The colorful settings, beautiful soundtrack, and basic controls made it a great experience that constantly piqued my interest, even if it never challenged me to master it other than deciphering its cryptic environmental clues. Instead, Abzu relishes in giving you freedom to simply enjoy exploring the fascinating deep blue sea.",1
"857","There's a massive amount of content in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, though especially if you played Black Ops 3 last year there’s little of it that’s particularly impressive.",1
"858","It sports a wonderful, diverse cast of characters, places a clear emphasis on strong fundamental play, it gives competitive players a great online experience, and it does it all while looking gorgeous. Strictly in terms of mechanics and competitive features, Street Fighter 5 is just about peerless, but it has quite a ways to go before it stacks up against other fighting games - including its own predecessor - in terms of overall content.",1
"859","Quantum Break is an artistically distinct shooter, with a compelling and malleable plot and excellent performances from its main players in both their digital and live-action forms. While I wish more thought had gone into maintaining the thrill of discovering its time-twisting powers from start to finish, it ultimately didn’t prevent me from thoroughly enjoying Quantum Break’s 10-hour campaign, two times over.",1

"863","The more I've played Hitman’s debut “episode” the more I've enjoyed it. Despite the often boneheaded AI and dire loading times, Hitman has definitely combined the best of both worlds. There’s scope for it to improve in some areas as the levels are released throughout the year but this is a fun, confident start.",1
"864","Headlander is an unexpectedly great take on Metroidviania-style action. Some of the objective design renders its flashier, body-endangering powers moot, but the quick and complex moment-to-moment gameplay carries it splendidly.",1
"865","Pokkén Tournament takes pieces from many fighting favorites and successfully blends them.",1
"866","The visceral and varied combat is fun, the beast-based gameplay is a winner, and the lure of camp-claiming, gear-crafting, beast hunting, and resource gathering remains irresistible. It’s weakened, however, by a disappointing lack of investment in its story, some often forgettable quests, and its vanilla villains, which unfortunately combine to make Primal feel like a step back from the memorable moments of Far Cry 3 and 4.",1
"867","In a time when shooters are competing to have the most modes, the biggest campaign, the most guns, and generally the most “stuff,” along comes Killing Floor 2, totally unconcerned with running that race. Its lack of modes and bosses will eventually turn away anyone but the most dedicated of fans, but its foundation is so fun and rock solid that, even if you only plan on playing for a few weeks with your friends, there’s plenty here to enjoy.",1
"868","System Rift does an admirable job of tying Breach mode into the main story while starting to fill in the gaps between Human Revolution and Mankind Divided, but it doesn't feel complete unto itself. You’ll get two to four hours more of excellent Deus Ex gameplay, and a glimpse of what the future may hold, but not much more, which is just a bit of a tease.",1
"869","Nuka-World has a great setting that’s densely packed with spectacle, surprises, and tough battles (depending on your level), and the ability to conquer settlements back on the main map is a fun novelty, but the lack of meaningful decisions leave it feeling more like an actual theme park ride than a choose-your-own-adventure story.",1
"870","A lack of balance robs the combat of much of its fun and renders many of the more interesting gameplay systems moot, but it didn’t dampen the emotional impact of I Am Setsuna’s heartfelt message for me.",1
"871","It’s hard to criticize something that seems like it was tailor-made for a wannabe competitive player like me, but I just can’t ignore how little Street Fighter 5 does for the average fighting game player.",1
"872","Star Fox Guard is a fun action-tower defense game about managing different perspectives to put out fires.",1
"873","Dead Rising 4 has the best core gameplay the series has ever seen. Its inventive and humorous ways to put down the dead are something I still haven’t tired of, and its surprisingly interesting plot is more than just a zombie-killing delivery system. Despite the technical blemishes that come with the series, its lack of co-op story mode play, and the fun-yet-unreliable multiplayer, Frank West’s return brings the series some fresh ideas, a ton of bloody mayhem, and a whole lot of cracking wise. Here’s hoping he sticks around for a while.",1
"874","It’s difficult but fair, and fast-paced but satisfying through to the end. And with a story so dangerously loaded with trope upon trope, it’s a joy to see Headlander sidestep some cliches with a beautiful setting, dark humor, and, well… a rocket-powered head. That’ll do the trick.",1
"875","The three almost entirely separate characters and play-styles keep the familiar Telltale formula feeling fresh and inviting. While some of the dialogue does feel overly expositional, it’s hopefully only there to provide concrete padding for future episodes, and the gorgeous, high-action combat sequences and creative detective work provide the right amount of contrast.",1
"876","The Painted World of Ariandel presents a land that’s both enticing and dangerous, and there’s plenty of challenges to face even if you won’t have to face them too many times. However, unless you really love dueling in PvP arenas and can find sustained interest there, this adventure may serve as more of an appetizer than a full course meal.",1
"877","The campaign is ignorable and the multiplayer needs a little technical work to be as good as last year’s, but the overly silly Zombies mode keeps me coming back. It may not stand out in a year that’s been crowded with great shooters, but it still produces that familiar Call of Duty action.",1
"878","Eagle Flight surprised me with how quickly I felt at home flying and fighting with other birds above Paris. It features some of the best and most responsive and comfortable gameplay available on the PSVR, though like most current VR games its appeal may be short-lived if you’re not a completionist who’s crazy about collectibles or high scores. This is a weird idea, well executed, that soars high.",1
"879","It’s a tribute to Telltale that the intricate, multi-layered plot and diverse cast of intertwined villains and madmen makes episode three’s lack of consequence and gameplay shortcomings excusable.",1
"880","Takes all of the solid foundations established by Episode 1, trims most of the fat, and continues to build an engaging Dark Knight story in a unique and uncharted version of the D.C. legend’s universe.

"884","I enjoyed just about every minute I spent playing Steep. Grandiose, attractive environments serving as the backdrop to varied, intense challenges are enough on their own to make this wintry playground somewhere I was always delighted to go back to and spend more time in - a feeling I still have even after finishing the bulk of the content, though the lack of mechanical customization and progression makes it harder to find reasons to return.",1

"887","Job Simulator's simple tasks are made fun by its absurdist sense of humor and goofy props. It'll test the limits of the PlayStation VR's motion tracking abilities by enticing you to reach for every object and device you can see, which sometimes makes things a little frustrating. But the rewards for experimentation make it well worth doing.",1

"890","Progression and microtransaction problems aside, after a VR stint in EVE Valkyrie I don’t think I’ll ever be able to go back to playing a dogfighting game on a regular screen. It’s just too good at showing me what I’ve been missing by not being able to look around freely as I pursue or evade targets. The intense and movie-like moments of strafing an enemy carrier while dodging incoming fire are a thrill.",1
"891","Human: Fall Flat’s slapstick controls and ridiculous animation do a great job of making repeated, frustrating, and unfair failure at physics puzzles seem fun for a while. And when that fun runs out, you can extend it by bringing in a friend and drawing silly things on your goofball character. If you don’t play it, watch someone play it.",1

"893","Once you break free from the tactics-focused mindset of most RTS games, Ashes of the Singularity is a challenging, engrossing, and cerebral exercise in strategy that has me mentally iterating on army compositions, build timings, and board deployment schemes even when I’m not playing it.",1
"894","Star Fox Zero’s fun stages and impressive boss fight give me lot of reasons to jump back in and play them over and over, and especially enjoyed them in co-op until I got a hang of juggling two screens myself. I’ve played 15 hours and I still haven’t found everything. Learning to use the unintuitive controls is a difficult barrier to entry, though it comes with a payoff if you can stick with it.",1
"895","I really miss 2K Showcase, and 2K17 is still weak in areas that I feel should have been shored up by now, but its excellent combat, and generous amounts of customization help it retain its title.",1
"896","WWE 2K17 doesn’t make any big, drastic changes, but its smart gameplay tweaks have revitalized match types I’d ignored the past few years.

"898","The results are satisfying. The story mode is brief, the narrative is mundane, and sadly the all-too-familiar Fallout 4 bugs are still hanging around, but the overall experience is rewarding, imaginative, and a pleasure to play.",1
"899","Lincoln is an incredible protagonist and New Bordeaux is a fantastic setting thematically, and it would’ve been great to see them put to better use.",1

That’s a bummer, because Lincoln is an incredible protagonist and New Bordeaux is a fantastic setting thematically, and it would’ve been great to see them put to better use.",1
"902","While Fire and Ice’s art direction and music are woefully generic, the well-constructed level layouts create a solid arcade-style experience that accomplishes a sense of extraordinary speed while accommodating a reasonable degree of control. Sonic Boom successfully draws from much of what makes the best of classic Sonic game play satisfying, sprinkles in a better-conceived exploratory structure, and remixes it into an intelligent, cohesive, and rewarding package.",1
"903","Nex Machina is not for the faint of heart, but a recipe to delight those looking for an attractive, arcadey challenge to overcome.",1
"904","Resident Evil 7 grounds itself in elements that made the original great while still indulging in a risky new shift in style that both helps and hurts the beloved formula in equal measure. But it’s also the closest a numbered sequel has come to recapturing Resident Evil’s slow, but thrilling and atmospheric adventure game roots in a while — a welcome return that I truly hope to see more of in the future.",1

"906","Funny and fresh from beginning to end, Paradigm is a traditional point-and-click adventure game full of heart and decapitated heads in jars. The Eastern European setting, great voice acting, and confident comedy shine throughout its roughly six hours. Relatively simple puzzles aside, Paradigm offers a fresh and memorable entry in a genre that I'm happy to see alive and well in 2017.",1
"907","To distinguish itself from the MOBA crowd, Battlerite went for pure, skill-based action and hit the mark dead center. The fluid mouse-and-WASD-driven combat makes every move count and the quick pace of its 10-minute matches never lets off the gas. Even with its lackluster randomized progression system robbing it of momentum, Battlerite keeps me coming back to improve and add to my bag of tricks along the way. Stunlock’s approach to MOBA combat creates a near-even playing field that makes each outplay feel earned, whether it was me or my foe picking up the win. These arenas are places I can see myself brawling for a long time to come.",1
"908","Based on its colorful world, beautiful animation, and source material you might expect Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle to be “My first turn-based tactics game.” But you’re in for a surprise: even for XCOM vets some of its battles are challenging puzzles. Some of its tougher levels do devolve into a trial-and-error slog, but a good mix of enemies, objectives, and character abilities keep things interesting.",1
"909","Prey’s curious alternate-history universe, intriguing sidequests, hidden threats, and detailed environmental storytelling make Talos I a joy to explore. The unsettling sense of paranoia that comes from knowing any object could turn out to be a hidden enemy gives even the quiet moments a palpable tension. All of that picks up the slack for combat and stealth that doesn’t feel fresh enough to sustain it throughout what can be a long game.",1
"910","It was wonderfully satisfying to have more Dishonored to play, even if Death of the Outsider doesn’t quite meet the high bar Dishonored 2 set in story or mission design. Even though it’s a shorter and slightly shallower game, there are some exciting new abilities and interesting changes to the energy system, and the freedom from consequences of Chaos further encourage experimentation and freedom. All in all, it’s a worthy end to the story that began five years ago.",1
"911","Despite the frustrations its upgrade system often caused me, I had a good time navigating Nex Machina’s array of twin-stick shooter challenges. The appealing art, energetic soundtrack, and pixel-perfect gamepad controls made me own every failure and look forward to whatever might come next.",1
"912","Uncharted: The Lost Legacy succeeds on the strength of its characters, writing, and phenomenal depiction of India’s jungles and ruins. Being in the company of Chloe and Nadine keeps its overly familiar action sequences and disappointingly empty open-world area interesting, and it regains its footing in smart puzzles and thrilling cinematic moments.",1
"913","Ultimately, FIFA 18 introduces enough new ideas to suggest it’s not sitting on the laurels of its success. However, it’s a simplified experience, one that fails to embrace the complexity of football at the highest level. Its focus on attack makes for spectacular matches, but they often feel like extravagant offensive training sessions than a proper match with depth and strategy.",1

"915","There’s a lot to love in Nintendo’s second iteration of its quirky shooter, especially the way Splatoon 2 emphasizes splatting the ground just as much as it does inking your opponents. The new additions to its single-player campaign and multiplayer modes are a step in the right direction, but it still has some work to do to make joining online games and voice chat less of a hassle. Still, with an addicting new Salmon Run co-op mode and the promise of free updates like the ones that helped the original Splatoon come into its own, I expect Splatoon 2 to keep me hooked.",1
"916","Hand of Fate 2 doesn’t change much of the concept that made the first game so appealing, but everything here – whether it's challenges, smarter deck building, companion characters, and better combat – marks a major improvement over what we saw in 2015. Repetitiveness can still be a problem, but it takes much longer for it to show up. This time around, this is definitely a hand worth playing.",1
"917","Dark Souls 3: The Ringed City has found a way to revisit the past without a cheap reliance on nostalgia, wrapping up the story of Dark Souls in a way that will be satisfying for fans who enjoy digging into the rich lore the series has been building for the last few years.

"920","The Evil Within 2 gives you more options to play your way in a much bigger survival-horror playground than the original. Although a disjointed plot and weak protagonist make it slow to get started, being pursued through an intriguingly bizarre world by plentiful and disturbing monsters kept my palms sweaty and my heart in my throat thanks to a strict adherence to the most important survival horror rule: you should always be on the back foot.",1

"922","The Crimson Court pumps Darkest Dungeon full of disturbing blood-sucking enemies, a challenging new class, and a marathon-style new area that forces you to think differently about how to sustain your team over a long run. While there’s definitely enough new content in The Crimson Court to come back to Darkest Dungeon for, it’s more the kind of DLC that mixes things up for a new replay than an essential upgrade you should install from the beginning.",1
"923","Ultimately, Danganronpa V3 doesn’t add too much new to the series. But that’s okay – it doesn’t need to reinvent the wheel when the wheel we already have still rolls out eclectic characters and shocking moments so reliably. It’s a great rollercoaster of hope and despair with a climax that made me sit back and think about everything that just happened. The road to the end of Danganronpa V3 is long and twisted, but the ride is well worth it.",1
"924","On the battlefield, Fire Emblem Echoes: Shades of Valentia is a delightful look into the simpler combat of Fire Emblem’s past. Elsewhere, it carefully guides the series forward into new territory. There’s not as much depth as I expect from this series, but whether I was exploring 3D forests and caves in a series first or learning first hand why Fire Emblem’s early entries are considered a formidable challenge, it was usually good old-fashioned fun.",1

"927","A lot of games tout the ability to “play how you want to play,” but Sniper Elite 4’s missions and mechanics actually are robust enough to back up that claim. Picking apart the Nazi war machine piece by piece, using whatever plan comes to mind, is a blast. The way it encourages you to stay mindful, experiment, and get better is a refreshing vote of confidence, even if it doesn’t always reward the extra effort you’re putting in.",1
"928","The Champions’ Ballad isn’t the extra dose of story for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild that many fans were expecting, but it would be churlish to turn down another chunk of hours with one of gaming’s greatest achievements. Even better, those hours are filled with new surprises, endgame-level challenges, and the weirdest post-game reward of recent years.",1
"929","Battle Chef Brigade successfully mixes genres to create something wholly engaging. The charming art direction and characters, creative combat, and clever puzzle mechanics help put Battle Chef Brigade squarely in its own genre. Despite a few storytelling stumbles and some minimal repetition, the sunny disposition of Trinket Studios’ puzzle/platformer/beat ‘em up ultimately shines through.",1
"930","The Elder Scrolls: Legends may not be the most visually appealing CCG, but what it lacks in looks it makes up for in modes, mechanics and card design. This is well worth checking out for fans of The Elder Scrolls or digital card games in general. And like all great CCGs, the more you put into it, the more you’ll get out of it.",1
"931","A beautiful and capable 4X game, with memorable personality that's seemingly calculated down to the pixel level. It doesn't deviate much from the genre's norms, but it delivers a generally satisfying 4X experience with only a few missteps in combat and diplomacy. Provided you're also okay with tackling a steep learning curve, it's also a satisfying entry point for the genre.",1
"932","Another step forward on the court, improving on the series’ already great gameplay. You’re rewarded for smart, controlled basketball when dribbling, driving, and playing defense in ways that make sense for the players you’re controlling. In the side modes, results are mixed.",1
"933","Solving every puzzle won’t take too long, but Snipperclips is continuously clever in its puzzle design and adorably fun to watch play.

"935","Yakuza Kiwami makes great strides in updating the classic original Yakuza game to modern standards. But while it adds better combat, bizarrely charming side quests, and a gorgeous graphical revamp, it also ignores some of the original’s biggest problems in pacing and storytelling. And because of its relatively short length, Yakuza Kiwami’s fun trip through the tangled web of Japan’s criminal underground feels like a prelude to something bigger and better to come.",1
"936","After a couple of story hiccups, Gravity Rush 2 righted itself and pulled me in with the personality of its world and wide variety of activities. The new gravity powers and styles make combat exciting, and well-written side quests and character relationships grant better insight into Kat’s universe. After 40 hours I found it hard to put the controller down, and I can’t wait to jump back in to finish every sidequest I can find.",1

"938","The amount of action that can transpire within a couple of seconds in Nidhogg 2 makes for two-player combat that’s both intense and hilarious to play or watch with friends. Nidhogg 2’s visual style might not be for everyone, but its sharp, minimalist duelling is still smart and chaotic enough to allow for endless couch competition.",1
"939","Life is Strange: Before the Storm shows a lot of promise in its first few hours despite the same weaknesses in its script as the original Life is Strange series. The new talk-back mechanic fits Chloe’s character well, challenging you to roleplay as an angsty teen to get the best results. Everything is pointing towards a heartbreaking story with interesting characters, but the lack of finesse behind how it’s delivered and potential absence of impact from player choice give me some reservations.",1
"940","Whether you’re crawling through the trenches in the campaign’s D-Day landing, fighting on the competitive battlefields, or lopping off gruesome undead soldiers’ heads in Nazi Zombies, Call of Duty: WW2 offers a surprisingly fast-paced and fun World War II experience.",1
"941","Pokkén Tournament DX serves as a definitive edition of Nintendo’s fighting game, and it fits well on the Switch aside from choppy split-screen multiplayer. Five new characters and a new three-on-three mode are noteworthy additions, though the new challenge mode doesn’t live up to its name.",1

All of that picks up the slack for combat and stealth that doesn’t feel fresh enough to sustain it throughout what can be a long game.",1
"943","For Honor has some dents in its shiny armor, such as the mediocre campaign, the frugal economy, and the snowballing victories in team modes. But it’s hard to be mad too long when I consider that the melee combat system is second to none and a joy to learn, take your licks, and then learn some more. I could feel myself becoming a better warrior with this deep, flexible, and complete fighting system. The more I play For Honor, the more I want to play For Honor.",1
"944","Battle Chasers: Nightwars’ combat and activity-dense world scratch the JRPG itch, even if the storytelling and character development leave a fair bit to be desired. Its attractive dungeons and outdoor regions are fun to get lost in, and there are just enough hidden treasures to claim to make exploration rewarding in a more than visual capacity.",1
"945","The most important parts of LA Noire have aged beautifully, with incredibly detailed faces, diverse characters, and unique, challenging crimes to solve as a detective. The top-notch writing and voice acting bring 1940s Los Angeles to life, but are let down by a dull open world with frequent frame rate drops. Aside from difficulty aiming in gun fights, it’s a smart port with accurate motion controls and the ability to play almost entirely touchscreen, too.",1
"946","With a set of thieving and assassination tools that beg to be used creatively, Heat Signature’s puzzle-like missions are great for jumping into for a few goes at a time to try something just crazy enough to work. That’s when the fun stuff happens.",1
"947","Call of Duty: WW2 offers a surprisingly fast-paced and fun World War II experience. The campaign features a more personal story, while the new War multiplayer mode alleviates some of my frustrations with the generally small multiplayer maps. Of all the parts, though, Nazi Zombies is a standout with its wonderfully creepy setting and puzzle-like tasks. It’s mostly what you’d expect from a great Call of Duty game, and a near-miss for a spot in the lineup of top Call of Duty games.",1
"948","Golf Story's clever writing and sound golf fundamentals keep it entertaining, even through some stale moments. Despite its light-hearted RPG structure, there’s a challenging and very real golf game here that’s worth coming back to even after the story is over. But it left me wishing that more of the campaign focused on the golf itself, and less on the often repetitive side tasks.",1
"949","Fallout 4 VR lets you experience the post-nuclear future in a much more intimate way. Its adaptation to the Vive’s hand-tracked Touch controls works fairly well for moving and shooting, but poorly for using the Pip Boy’s clunky interface, and that’s something you’ll need to do frequently. But it’s worth putting up with to come face to face with Fallout 4’s characters, monsters, and settings.",1
"950","For Honor has some dents in its shiny armor, such as the mediocre campaign, the frugal economy, and the snowballing victories in team modes. But it’s hard to be mad too long when I consider that the melee combat system is second to none and a joy to learn, take your licks, and then learn some more. I could feel myself becoming a better warrior with this deep, flexible, and complete fighting system. The more I play For Honor, the more I want to play For Honor.",1
"951","If you’ve already played the original LEGO City Undercover on Wii U, then there is little reason to pick up this re-release. However, if you were one of the many who missed it the first time around then LEGO City Undercover remains a hilarious riff on police procedurals, built upon a GTA-for-juniors open world blueprint, and stuffed with enjoyable side missions and collectibles to hunt down.",1
"952","The Master Trials doesn’t make any epochal changes to the established Breath of the Wild formula, but by packing in one of the game’s best quests, some welcome new features, and a hard mode to be reckoned with, it more than paves the way way for the starrier story expansion to come.",1
"953","Graceful Explosion Machine builds an intense, addictive shoot-em-up around a satisfying weapon-juggling system and smart enemies. The Switch’s HD Rumble adds a unique feeling to every explosion in this colorful shooter, and earning a good spot on the leaderboard is an intense challenge thanks to dense swarms of enemies. But even when a pesky foe slapped down my scoring run, I always had the urge to jump back into these crowded corridors and try again.",1
"954","Thankfully, whether you’re soaking in the cosmos around you, banking large sums of credits from a well-planned trading haul, or surviving a harrowing encounter with space pirates in dazzling ship-to-ship combat, Elite Dangerous has plenty to keep me excited to come back.",1
"955","I can wholeheartedly recommend Bridge Constructor Portal as a rich, challenging puzzler with plenty of brain-twisters in store across its 60 levels. The pacing and methodical iteration it encourages meant it only ever taxed my mind, not my nerves. As a Portal fan’s nostalgia piece, it’s really not much better than a kitschy, amusement park gift shop recreation of the world many of us know and love – but the little nods serve well enough to enhance an already enjoyable puzzle game.",1
"956","The storytelling and writing are taken to new heights, continuing a trend of improvement in each content release since Orsinium in 2015. The addition of the Warden class gives new and returning players alike a fresh and versatile way to play through the 25 hours of content. While the Warden’s bear companion skill disappoints and the Battlegrounds need work, what Morrowind does well has kept me enthralled in the world of Tamriel.",1
"957","The addition of split-screen play, cursory in its execution as it may be, only makes the game more appealing to players who would prefer to experience LEGO City Undercover with a friend riding shotgun. And what's a good police story without a partner in crime-fighting?",1
"958","Arms’ clever take on boxing provides a simple premise with a startling amount of depth for those who would seek to master the stretching appendages. Its rapidly evolving lobby system had me sticking around for “just one more match.” There may not be a lot worth unlocking right now, but planned free updates may just give Arms some additional legs.",1

"960","Every murder The Sexy Brutale includes is uniquely fascinating to investigate, with the central loop of searching for clues and executing a plan to alter time continually engaging. I found Boone’s quest so fascinating, the Brutale’s secrets so alluring, and its world so charming that I rewound the clock just to spend a few more days in Lafcadio’s beautiful nightmare.",1
"961","A lot of games tout the ability to “play how you want to play,” but Sniper Elite 4’s missions and mechanics actually are robust enough to back up that claim. Picking apart the Nazi war machine piece by piece, using whatever plan comes to mind, is a blast. The way it encourages you to stay mindful, experiment, and get better is a refreshing vote of confidence, even if it doesn’t always reward the extra effort you’re putting in.",1
"962","Flashy and loaded with complex, micromanagement-heavy warfare. Its single-player campaign is long and challenging, but feels uninspired because it rarely makes creative use of the three factions’ abilities. In multiplayer it’s even more demanding and intimidatingly chaotic, but with only one mode and not a lot of maps, it seems limited. Relic deserves credit for not simply remaking the same game with prettier graphics, but this hybrid approach doesn’t feel as strong as Dawn of War 2’s memorable tactical focus.",1
"963","Overcooked is one of the freshest couch co-op games I’ve ever played. It’s a perfect blend of strategy and chaos, asking you and your teammates to think on your feet as its smart and strange levels do everything they possibly can to make sure you are shouting at each other. The Switch port has some framerate and rumble issues that keep it from matching the best versions available, but for local multiplayer fun it’s hard to beat.",1
"964","Mostly succeeds on two fronts: As a fresh way to revisit an old classic, and as the ideal entry point for players who haven’t yet smacked rival bikers with a two-by-four on the Mine Road or figured out the combination to Old Man Corley’s safe. There are a couple of sticking points for both old and new players, including some technical issues and (especially for the latter) that questionable “adventure game logic” which is anything but logical. Nevertheless, there’s never been a better time to hit the open road with Ben and his gang.",1
"965","I wish I’d been given the chance to actually solve more of The Riddler’s puzzles on my own – adventure games are traditionally all about that, after all – but the tension and drama that permeate The Enemy Within’s first episode make it a winner. This strong start also leaves me very excited to see how John Doe’s inevitable transformation into The Joker plays out, and morbidly fascinated to see what scars this version of Gotham City will leave behind on its inhabitants.",1
"966","The most far-reaching package of content in the franchise, stretching from the series’ earliest moments all the way to its most recent, but an understanding of its scope requires some history with Kingdom Hearts lore. And because much of it touches on familiar territory, as a whole it lacks an essential feeling that the main numbered entries and spinoffs (like Birth By Sleep) evoke.",1
"967","In its best game modes, LawBreakers manages to make simply moving around feel amazing. Learning how to fall with style in the most deadly way possible is a thrilling challenge. Getting stuck playing a weak mode and map thanks to the grab-bag matchmaking can be frustrating, but it doesn’t ruin an otherwise fast and tense shooter that lets you gleefully propel yourself through low-gravity with rocket boots and miniguns.",1
"968","Dragon Quest Heroes 2 feels like a step forward in some ways, but a step back in others. The new additions to combat are nice, but the attempts to bring more RPG elements to the story missions don’t always work out for the best – at worst, they wind up transforming an enjoyable action game into a boring slog. At least it shows that Omega Force is willing to try new things with their long-established formula.",1
"969","Hob is a beautiful Zelda-like puzzler with fun combat elements that takes place on an enchanting world where nature and machinery alter the landscape as easily as a twist of a Rubik's cube. The wordless approach to the story creates some confusion and the fix camera sometimes results in unnecessary deaths, but never does the time spent with Hob feel wasted.",1
"970","For Honor has some dents in its shiny armor, such as the mediocre campaign, the frugal economy, and the snowballing victories in team modes.

"972","This huge, wide-open shooter constantly shows its flaws in its mission variety and vehicle physics, but its strong, sandbox-style gameplay and seamless co-op kept me coming back for more madness. If you must repeat experiences over and over, you could far worse than helicopter chases, assassination missions, or drug busts gone wildly wrong.",1
"973","Outlast 2 is a terrifying sequel that builds upon the scares of the 2013 original. Even if its ambitious themes don’t always land and navigating through its world can be frustratingly inconsistent, there’s more wicked creativity at play here than I’ve seen in a horror game in a long time. Play it loud, in the dark.",1
"974","A great-looking remaster of a still fun, ridiculously over-the-top shooter from last generation that pokes fun at the genre while introducing its own distinctively violent, melee-heavy playstyle. On the other hand, it’s almost completely devoid of new content, which makes it less attractive for returning fans who were hoping for anything more than a facelift.",1
"975","There’s never been a better time to hit the open road with Ben and his gang.",1
"976","Mass Effect: Andromeda is an expansive action role-playing game with a few great moments that recapture the high points of the landmark trilogy that came before it, and energetic combat and fantastic sound effects create a potent sci-fi atmosphere. But without consistently strong writing or a breakout star in its cast to carry it through the long hours and empty spaces, disappointments like a lack of new races, no companion customization, and major performance problems and bugs take their toll.",1
"977","Virtual Rick-ality does a great job emulating the dark humor of the source material, even if it occasionally overindulges in its self-awareness.",1
"978","Absolver is a beautiful martial-arts fighting game that allows for an impressive degree of personalized play with its innovative combat deck system, which lets you learn skills from combat with other players and NPCs. Unfortunately, it only comes with a single PvP arena mode at launch, and its fascinatingly nebulous campaign breaks off early and abruptly. It feels like an early access game with a ton of potential, but it’s not quite there yet.",1
"979","In many ways, GT Sport is the most polished Gran Turismo game in over a decade. It looks great, feels great, and what’s here has been carefully and well executed. However, while I can forgive the sprinkling of eccentric nonsense, the lack of car and track content really hurts, and the online-only nature of the vast majority of it is worrying. Overall it just isn’t as complete as its key competitors.",1
"980","A great-looking remaster of a still fun, ridiculously over-the-top shooter from last generation that pokes fun at the genre while introducing its own distinctively violent, melee-heavy playstyle. On the other hand, it’s almost completely devoid of new content, which makes it less attractive for returning fans who were hoping for anything more than a facelift.",1
"981","The conclusion to Hell Is Empty didn’t give me my runaway future, but the prequel nature of Life Is Strange: Before The Storm made that an impossible dream. Instead, another story shoves it aside, trying to find the difference between what is right for someone and what is good for them, but there isn’t enough time in this episode to deliver this message and round out everything else. This pace leaves it rushed and somewhat tunnel-visioned. That said, characters I cared about and real, hard choices which often don’t feel truly right or wrong kept my gut firmly wrenched throughout. Light puzzles break up the talking and drama but again serve to remind us that correct isn’t necessarily right. Instead, there’s a strong single theme that’s delivered well in a story that isn’t afraid to get in a few punches.",1
"982","Sundered takes the 2D Metroidvania platforming formula augments it with some successful ideas that all but reward you for dying. Its procedurally generated levels are hit and miss, as the dynamic parts come off as bland in comparison to Sundered's impressive hand-drawn areas and epic boss fights. In addition, its randomly appearing enemy hordes sometimes lead it to devolve into mere button mashing and random deaths, but the knowledge that I’ll come back a little stronger each time makes it hurt less.",1
"983","Since there's never any feeling of the grim spectre of Father Time looming large and there are enough random events to shake up the daily routine, doing my virtual chores in these charming and beautiful towns and unlocking a steady stream of rewards is relaxing, despite some annoyances with unnecessary travel and unskippable animations. And since the only requirement of Trio of Towns is to prove that farm life is a noble life, the pressure to succeed is never daunting.",1
"984","The Surge makes good use of its detailed sci-fi setting and provides an engaging experience throughout the 30 to 40-hour campaign, mostly thanks to its widely customizable inventory and wickedly fun combat system. It may struggle to keep the action moving and tell a strong story amid the chaos of battle, and its weapon progression plateaued early, but it offers some interesting ideas and delivers a solid new take on a familiar genre.",1
"985","Balancing the objective-based main phase with the rushed and frantic giant monster-powered Rampage phase gives Gigantic a fast and distinctive pace that separates it from the MOBA crowd.",1
"986","The malleable quality of Fire Emblem’s weapons-triangle and pairing systems make them a natural fit for the hack n’ slash genre. Even when I could barely tell what was going on on the crowded battlefield and my troops were a little too codependent, I enjoyed directing the action and jumping in to be part of the carnage. And while Fire Emblem Warriors makes poor use of the Fire Emblem universe’s story and history, we still get traces of the relationships between the characters that make it memorable.",1
"987","The fifth episode encompasses both what worked and didn’t about A New Frontier — namely, the ideas of allegiance, love, and family for the former and erratic pacing and an inability to make the overarching story of much interest in the latter. But the season finale spends much more time on those successful aspects, capping A New Frontier in satisfying fashion while setting up a potentially exciting continuation down the road.",1
"988","Like an 80-overs old Dukes ball, Ashes Cricket may be a little rough around the seams. Yet it still manages to impress where it counts: out in the middle. There has never been a cricket game this approachable, fully-featured, or fun, and the inclusion of licensed Ashes squads and stadia is just the icing on what is already an exceedingly customisable cricket cake. With a bit more shine on it via future patches and community-created content it could be well and truly amazing, but even as it stands Ashes Cricket is the best videogame representation of the sport to date.",1
"989","LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 doesn’t deviate much from the established LEGO template, but its wide variety of settings, heroes, and abilities make it constantly fun to play, especially in co-op. The combat is still quite simple and it’s sometimes difficult to tell what you should do next, but the story is lighthearted and fun enough that mild annoyances like these fade into the background.",1
"990","The Surge makes good use of its detailed sci-fi setting and provides an engaging experience throughout the 30 to 40-hour campaign, mostly thanks to its widely customizable inventory and wickedly fun combat system.

"992","It presents an interesting world to explore but wastes its potential by recycling environments from early missions late in the game. Co-op mode is fun, too, but only selectively as some stealth-only missions seem far more manageable on one's own.",1

"995","Styx: Shards of Darkness greatly resembles the earlier Styx: Master of Shadows from 2014, but Cyanide improved the gameplay this time around with the inclusion of craftable weapons, the lack of a lock-on in combat, and expanded abilities. It presents an interesting world to explore but wastes its potential by recycling environments from early missions late in the game. Co-op mode is fun, too, but only selectively as some stealth-only missions seem far more manageable on one's own.",1
"996","While Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite’s tag-team fights are like a bolt of lightning from Mjolnir, its story is dreadful and its characters look like they were deliberately designed to spawn a million derpy memes. It manages to be easily one of the worst and also one of the best fighting games in recent memory all at once. Like its heroes and villains, it’s stuck between two worlds.",1
"997","Under Pressure transitions us off of the high-tempo radio hit that was the season opener and into a more relaxed slow jam punctuated with some meaty action riffs. The slower drip of meaningful events meant I didn’t come off of it with the same level of feel good euphoria I had after finishing Tangled Up in Blue, but Telltale is still doing an excellent job adapting this eccentric hero team to its tried-and-true format - particularly when the focus is on developing the characters and the relationships between them.",1
"998","Doom VFR is a brave shooter that proves that VR games don’t have to be conservative with movement to work. Fast-paced action with a great stable of recognizable weapons and enemies makes it a challenging rush, once you find your VR legs. It’s a shame VFR story didn’t get the same self-aware treatment as Doom did, but even if it’s all about warping and gunning, that’s more than enough.",1
"999","Despite its predictable and unsatisfying story and hard-to-ignore bugs, it’s a full-fledged sci-fi shooter that feels fantastic to play with Sony’s high-quality PSVR Aim Controller (and slightly awkward without it). Several smart control options and design choices cater to a variety of different types of players, and the gunplay is second to none in VR. If I were to recommend one shooter to a PSVR owner, this would be it.",1
"1000","Despite the fact that this is a first-person VR adventure mostly devoid of the combat platforming that made the original Psychonauts so memorable, it still carries the same spirit. The wonderful writing and solid use of VR make it a fitting continuation to the series that left me pining for Psychonauts 2, especially when it ended after three hours and visiting just a handful of locations.",1

"1002","When I’m having a good time in ARK, I’m having a really good time. The problem is that those moments are usually one part to every nine parts menial grinding and crafting - especially at the later tech tiers. Having to repeat so much work after failing an attempt at a boss feels far too punishing, and some really dumb dinosaurs can take a lot of the challenge and sense of danger out of the many primal locations. Even with all of those quirks, however, I’m still hungry to play more after the 60 hours I’ve spent so far.",1

"1008","When you’re fully geared up and The Messenger is hitting you with brand new stages and challenges that you haven’t seen before, The Messenger is an amazing, must-play experience. Taken as a whole, it’s brought down only by fetch quests that make The Messenger last several hours longer than it feels like it should.",1
"1009","Its storyline is gripping, its weapons-heavy fighting system accommodates no shortage of spectacle, and it serves up plenty of enjoyable side activities – both mini and macro – to divert to or return for after the story wraps. Yakuza 0 may still be the high watermark for the series on the PS4, but Yakuza Kiwami 2 isn’t too far behind.",1
"1010","Moss made a wonderful first impression and never let up. Spending four hours with Quill in this VR world was a joy, and no one element or environment type wears out its welcome. Its mix of combat and puzzles hooked me quickly, always kept things fresh, and left me wanting more.",1
"1011","Ni No Kuni 2: Revenant Kingdom distinguishes itself from its predecessor by layering fast-paced, real-time combat and an engaging kingdom building system atop more traditional RPG systems and quests. It’s a shame it delivers so few truly memorable characters and restricts so much of its storytelling to text on screen, but by the end of Ni No Kuni 2 the broader themes certainly resonate and the 40+ hour journey has been well worth it.",1
"1012","The Missing: J.J. Macfield and the Island of Memories is an evocative, offbeat adventure with a sinister yet imaginative gameplay hook. Its story suffers slightly from subpar voice acting and an eagerness to tell more than show, but for the most part this is a dark, strange and utterly compelling journey into the tortured mind of its main character, and one absolutely well worth taking.",1
"1013","Hitman 2 doesn’t add much of note to the structure of its predecessor and thus feels more like Hitman 1.5 than a full-blown sequel. But that’s not a bad thing. By offering more of the deepest, fullest stealth sandboxes in gaming in one single package rather than six episodic ones, it earns its keep. The inclusion of Hitman (2016) is a bonus for those that didn’t catch the reboot initially. Here’s hoping they put more effort into the plot next time.",1
"1014","While the campaign smartly doesn’t overstay its welcome — it took me about six hours to complete, including some distractions — collecting all 80 of Yoku’s hidden Wickerlings, finding all of its chests, and completing some other simple missions like delivering letters made me want to keep playing even after the credits rolled.",1
"1015","Two Point Hospital revitalizes the business management genre with flair, character, and enthusiasm. Easily understandable tips and icons make it relatively stress-free to get a working urgent care center running smoothly, while the potential for deep optimization through tweaking building layout and making wise hiring and training decisions leave plenty to munch on for the micromanagement lovers among us. If we’re on the verge of another classic genre renaissance, this is a great first foot forward.",1
"1016","The generically beautiful Summerset is on the smaller side in terms of overall new additions to The Elder Scrolls Online, but even after completing the majority of the side quests and all of the main storyline I feel compelled to go back.",1

"1018","A novel Metroidvania-pinball hybrid that stands out as something wholly unique. It blends those clashing genres with a beautiful island style, and its satisfying flippers and bumpers make uncovering its wide island a ton of fun. Retreading completed areas while hunting for secrets can occasionally get stale, but Yoku’s Island Express has a refreshingly positive attitude that kept me smiling the whole way through.",1
"1019","Yakuza 6: The Song of Life presents the most detailed virtual chunk of Japan the series has managed to date, and its story provides a satisfying end to the Kizama Kiryu saga. However, as far as gameplay goes, Yakuza 6 doesn’t make enough of an effort to break new ground, making it weaker overall than last year’s Yakuza Zero.",1

Donkey Kong is literally a game-changing character with abilities that are fun to learn and use, and Cranky Kong’s alright, too. The main downside is that you’re locked into one team composition, which limits your ability to change up your playstyle or replay battles differently.",1

"1029","You shouldn’t buy PES 2019 for its new modes - there aren’t any of note. Nor should you buy it for major changes to existing modes - the ones made are minor. If you do opt in this year, it should be for the focus on player individuality that sets this iteration apart from all previous years.",1
"1030","The prospect of playing such a lovingly crafted tribute to the vintage heyday of Konami's seemingly abandoned Castlevania series more than makes up for a few out-of-place boss fights and a slightly too punitive death penalty. Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon delivers a brief but effective burst of nostalgia, and thanks to its many creative modifiers it contains enough replay value to engage (and challenge) anyone who pines for gaming's bygone days.",1
"1031","A beautifully dark game, and I’m in love with its hard-hitting, meaty melee weapons. It’s a gorgeous game with tons of fun play styles and customization options to uncover, even if most of the loot you earn for your efforts is a letdown.",1

This realism is betrayed by a few control issues that affect the timing when batting and an AI that doesn’t always behave as you’d expect. However, the unique Ego system allows you to tweak the difficulty of batting and fielding individually until you find the perfect challenge.",1
"1034","Though its social criticisms feel broad and rather clumsy so far, its core story of brotherhood and fraternity between two believable characters is already enormously touching.",1
"1035","Battlefield V is a grand and addictive shooter with some smart ideas for improving gunplay and team dynamics, but at launch it has too many technical issues and holes in its content to excel.",1
"1036","The first episode of choose-your-own-adventure drama Life is Strange 2 is an ambitious sequel that succeeds in its quietest moments.",1
"1037","Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate brings the majority of the series’ monsters into one package for a lengthy and exciting hunting extravaganza. While it feels dated in some ways post-Monster Hunter: World, it’s a great farewell tour for the old style of the franchise. If you can stomach the pacing problems and obtuse menu systems, it’s a worthwhile and challenging trek through the history of Monster Hunter.",1
"1038","It's not revolutionary, but Mega Man 11 feels almost like a classic Mega Man game, and is a good foundation for the next 10 games.",1
"1039","Powerful friends and new mechanics make for a delightful return to the Kanto region in Pokemon: Let's Go, Pikachu and Eevee.",1

"1041","You shouldn’t buy PES 2019 for its new modes - there aren’t any of note. Nor should you buy it for major changes to existing modes - the ones made are minor. If you do opt in this year, it should be for the focus on player individuality that sets this iteration apart from all previous years.",1
"1042","The Banner Saga 3 offers the darkest entry yet in this beautifully animated tactical RPG trilogy. Choices matter and come fast and furious, making this journey a thrilling roller coaster from the opening moments to the ending credits.",1

"1047","BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle is like a jigsaw puzzle made of pieces from four entirely different sets, that by some miracle still manage to fit together to make a unique and mesmerizing tag fighting game. Aside from its unsatisfying single-player mode and aggravating paywalled characters, it’s just the right blend of accessibility and depth, and one of the best entry points into fighting games you’ll find.",1
"1048","Ultimately Battle for Azeroth is a worthy if somewhat less ambitious successor to 2016’s Legion. the diverse new zones and more intimate storytelling alone make Battle for Azeroth an adventure worth diving into.",1
"1049","A net positive, though it leaves me awaiting the expected second expansion for Civilization 6’s true golden age.",1
"1050","If you go into A Way Out thinking its mandatory two-player co-op is a gimmick, you’ll likely come out of it realizing that it couldn’t have been done any other way. Vincent and Leo’s journey will have you and a friend performing tasks together both mundane and dramatic, and the result is a memorable, variety-packed cinematic adventure that feels like what Telltale’s games might’ve evolved into if they’d leaned into game mechanics instead of phasing them out.",1
"1051","Though I wish its story had been handled with a softer touch, especially considering the subtlety that can be conveyed through its tech and performances, its well-written and acted central trio were vital enough to me that I found myself feeling genuine distress when they were in danger and a sense of victory when they triumphed. Most importantly, Detroit offers a multitude of transparent branching paths that entice further playthroughs, and choices have a permanence that raise the stakes throughout.",1
"1052","In changing the interplay between stealth and combat, Mutant Year Zero spins an interesting and intense new perspective on turn-based tactics that pushes you to get the most out of every move you make.",1
"1053","A Way Out’s finest moments come when it’s at its most cinematic.",1
"1054","The catchy song that plays over Pit People’s ending credits (and has been stuck in my head for the last several days) proclaims: And it all makes sense now! That might be overstating things, since its tactical battles never played out the way I expected due to each character having a mind of their own when it comes to what to actually attack or heal. But pit People’s weird world has a special, quirky way of being amusing no matter what you’re doing. I enjoyed it mostly in small doses, as the bright colors, twisted sense of humor, and goofy, energetic soundtrack can get to be a little much sometimes.",1
"1055","The Missing: J.J. Macfield and the Island of Memories is an evocative, offbeat adventure with a sinister yet imaginative gameplay hook. Its story suffers slightly from subpar voice acting and an eagerness to tell more than show, but for the most part this is a dark, strange and utterly compelling journey into the tortured mind of its main character, and one absolutely well worth taking.",1
"1056","Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition is a good-quality port of the Wii U game, but outside of much more stable performance and better local co-op it doesn’t add enough new content to make replaying the story mode interesting again if you’ve already tried it. Luckily, the Adventure Mode maps and 16 of the 31 unlockable characters are available from the start.",1
"1057","The Missing: J.J. Macfield and the Island of Memories is a dark, strange and utterly compelling journey.",1
"1058","A solid introduction to the world of Switch-powered cardboard craftables. It may get a bit tedious and repetitive during its laborious building and simplistic play sessions, but the creative freedom it allows once you dig a little deeper is truly something extraordinary.",1

"1060","EA went back to the gym with UFC 3 to work on many of the weaknesses that had the previous two games struggling to find their footing. A fantastic new striking system and a much-improved career mode lead the charge, but UFC 3 is still hamstrung by a cumbersome ground game, weird collision issues, and the straight-up terrible Ultimate Team Mode. It’s still not a knockout, but Round 3 is UFC’s best yet.",1
"1061","More often than not, Ancestors Legacy showed me a good time watching my berserkers, Teutonic knights, and Slavic tribesmen hack their way through forests, marshes, and the occasional open field. The weakness in the core infantry combat, which tilts a bit too much away from quick, tactical thinking and into correctly guessing how the enemy line will be arranged, was the main issue that kept me from really coming to love it.",1
"1062","'What Ails You’ takes The Enemy Within’s biggest and boldest step yet toward redefining the Joker’s role in the Batman universe – should you choose to push him in that direction (which I did).

"1063","It may be a very short diversion, but Donut County is a delight. It’s absolutely brimming with personality, has a killer soundtrack and visual aesthetic, and is based on an irresistible gameplay hook. I’d have loved more, but I guess I’ll just settle for playing through it again.",1

"1065","Because of the Switch’s two modes, The World Ends With You: Final Remix is simultaneously a good port and a bad one. Using handheld mode and touchscreen controls, Final Remix holds up as a great JRPG with tons of depth. It packs all the flair and charm seen in the DS original, along with some new incentives to keep playing after the story wraps. But the moment you dock the Switch and try to use motion controls TWEWY becomes a pain to play, which eliminates the fun of the new cooperative mode.",1
"1066","BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle is like a jigsaw puzzle made of pieces from four entirely different sets, that by some miracle still manage to fit together to make a unique and mesmerizing tag fighting game.

"1067","The asynchronous multiplayer is unquestionably the star of the show, and queuing up multiple online games at once means you’re never stuck waiting for an opponent, and that you can play at your own pace. But while the new City Game story mode is conceptually interesting, in practice the largely scripted sequence of story missions doesn’t allow for much in the way of meaningful gameplay depth.",1
"1068","There’s a shining suit of mail underneath Kingdom Come: Deliverance’s authentically medieval grime. Strong characters and storytelling, one of my favorite first-person melee combat systems ever, and special attention given to building moment-to-moment immersion come together as a mighty alloy that ranks among the most unique, memorable RPGs I’ve played in years.",1
"1069","If you can stick it out through an unforgiving and poorly explained learning phase, there’s a lot of excitement, challenge, and customization to enjoy beneath and beyond the grand, glass habitation domes of Surviving Mars. I wish I’d had more reasons to care about the people in my colony than just the balance sheets for synthetic polymers and microchips, but at the end of the Martian day, it’s like a SimCity sandbox where everyone can die at any time because you made a minor miscalculation in your electrical grid. And that’s actually pretty exciting.",1
"1070","Black Cat's intro is great, but the first DLC episode feels more like a first act than satisfying, standalone content.",1
"1071","It improves on a few areas historical Total War games have struggled with, but at the same time falls back into some bad, old habits that other games in the series were able to rise above. The overall tapestry reads as more than competent, and I could watch hardened huskarls with their massive axes crash into a Saxon shield wall all day. But there are too many blemishes for me to place it alongside some of its truly great peers like Attila and Warhammer.",1
"1072","While Strange Brigade can be frustrating at times, the charm of its 1930s world, the wonderfully exaggerated English alliteration of its narrator, and solid level design, combat encounters, and four-player co-op make it a strong, stylish third-person shooter.",1
"1073","Mario Tennis Aces is an extremely fun arcade tennis experience, colourful and dazzling to look at and smartly balanced in its back-and-forth play. With a little bit more care and depth given to the simple single-player mode and more variety added in the way of character and tournament customisation to give its multiplayer extra spice, Mario Tennis Aces could have been a true all-rounder. As it is, Mario Tennis Aces is still a lot of frantic tennis fun with friends.",1
"1074","Onrush managed to change the way I think about racing games. Its unorthodox online car-brawls and varied objectives go out of their way to feel different, and even when the maps become repetitive after a short while, its appeal remains for the simple fact that there’s no other arcade driving game quite like this.",1
"1075","LEGO DC Super Villains is a unique twist on the aging LEGO game premise that shifts the perspective and puts you in the shoes of The Joker, Lex Luthor, and other villains.",1
"1076","I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked playing NBA Live 19. The core basketball game and its various modes offer plenty of chances to have a fun basketball experience. The new animation system makes action on the court look and act more realistic than ever, and a robust training mode gives plenty of opportunity to improve. Unfortunately, lifeless, canned commentary and little in the way of capturing the feel of basketball culture holds NBA Live 19 back. In the world of basketball games, it’s the Eastern Conference to 2K’s Western Conference – good, but at the end of the season, the odds are heavily in the opponent’s favor.",1

"1080","A lot of what The Hidden Ones gets right is its ability to take familiar concepts from Assassin’s Creed Origins and make them feel new again by means of a new purpose, a new story, and a new creed. A new direction to the story that makes Bayek more relatable, high-level combat keeps quests challenging even when you’re fully leveled up, and a more rewarding pace of loot provide an opportunity to feel something new without straying too far from what I loved about Origins in the first place.",1
"1081","Whether you’re adventuring through Dream Land with up to three friends or playing with competent AI teammates, Kirby’s ever-rotating group of uniquely powered pals are the real stars of the show here. The creative ways you can combine abilities never gets old, which means there’s great potential for replayability especially with friends. I just wish the final boss battle hadn’t come just as the puzzles were starting to give me a challenge.",1
"1082","While Strange Brigade can be frustrating at times, the charm of its 1930s world, the wonderfully exaggerated English alliteration of its narrator, and solid level design, combat encounters, and four-player co-op make it a strong, stylish third-person shooter.",1
"1083","NBA 2K Playgrounds 2 adds depth to both the solo and multiplayer modes. Season mode improves the card collecting loop and Playgrounds Championship introduces ranked play for competitive users. The 2v2 basketball gameplay perhaps feels a bit too familiar but it’s refined in welcome ways. Pick-up-and-play arcade basketball is, thankfully, still alive and well.",1
"1084","The Space Marine campaign has some really cool ideas that help it not feel like you’re just hitting “Next Mission” over and over. It’s just a bummer that the controls get in the way of me being able to truly dive in and enjoy it, like having to eat a really nice Thanksgiving pie with just a spatula.",1
"1085","A great get for those who may have missed it the first time around, or anyone who might want to revisit (and re-destroy) the red planet. It may not add any new content to address the empty open world and bland story, but it does perform well, and everything I loved about Red Faction: Guerrilla is still front and center and looking better than ever.",1
"1086","If you enjoy DC heroes and villains as characters and don’t mind the simplistic gameplay and kid-friendly tone, then you'll like LEGO DC Super-Villains's super-powered romp through Gotham and Metropolis.",1
"1087","Even with dated graphics, EDF 5 is an energetic essay on action game design that is way too much fun to miss – especially with friends.",1
"1088","The Resistance DLC adds needed map variety to multiplayer and introduces another fun Nazi Zombies map. The tighter, dense map Valkyrie gives the new Resistance Division a chance to shine with plenty of close combat opportunities, while Anthropoid offers snipers space to work their magic.",1
"1089","The Bard's Tale 4: Barrows Deep is a rousing but technically rough adventure driven by great music, clever puzzles, and challenging turn-based combat.",1
"1090","While it didn’t wow me as a competitor to Endless Legend or Civ 6 in the 4X race, there’s a lot of action-saturated, tactically-driven fun to be had when you look at Gladius - Relics of war for what it truly is: a really well-done, turn-based 40K wargame. It’s one of the best turn-based 40K games I’ve played through that lens.",1
"1091","Detective Pikachu offers a bold take on the iconic Pokemon, which succeeds thanks to Pika Prompts that build Pikachu beyond detective stereotypes. Even though I figured out cases far before their end, each one utilized the world of Pokemon to its fullest, and ultimately offered a unique Pokemon experience that I hope we see done again soon.",1
"1092","A great get for those who may have missed it the first time around, or anyone who might want to revisit (and re-destroy) the red planet.

"1093","To be very clear: State of Decay 2 bugs out early and bugs out often.",1
"1094","Danger Zone 2 is exactly what I wanted the first Danger Zone to be: the true follow-up to Burnout’s classic Crash mode that EA won’t give me. It’s not as fully fleshed out or polished as my dream game of this type would be, but as a self-contained and one-note smash-up it shines like a spectacular fireball explosion. Now how about reviving the rest of Burnout? Road Rage mode, anyone?",1
"1095","FromSoftware’s foray into VR is as fascinating for its storytelling ambitions as it is disappointing in its overly familiar gameplay.",1
"1096","The thing that pulled me through Strange Brigade’s campaign and had me tackling the extra horde and score attack modes, though, is its sense of style.",1
"1097","ntuitive, authentic, and surprisingly realistic, Killing Floor: Incursion emphasizes the physical dimension of its virtual world, delighting in the tactile qualities of VR and making the most every little object. Whether you’re staring down the scope of a remarkably believable sniper rifle or clobbering enemies with the dismembered arm of one of their own fallen comrades, you never fail to have a clear, satisfying sense of how every item, weapon or body part feels.",1
"1098","Just Cause 4 is a slightly better version of Just Cause 3's destruction-fueled action, but lacks a big new idea to give it an identity of its own.",1
"1099","State of Decay 2’s zombie-infested maps are good places to scavenge, fight, and survive in. Combat is satisfyingly brutal and the special zombies inspire some real fear of permanent death, even though the Blood Plague turns out to be more of a sniffle. But the bugs are just as persistent as the zombies, and after a dozen or so hours the repetition of both eventually take their toll, making the appeal of replaying feel more limited than I’d expected for a sandbox RPG.",1
"1100","Secret of Mana HD Remaster is a bit of an odd duck. For every one thing it does to enhance the original, it makes a strange, distracting change or doesn’t make an obvious fix. Still, even as I waffled between loving it for its happy colors and lovable cast and feeling frustrated by its fussy AI and uneven difficulty, I always felt a childlike wonder at its relentless charm. Warts and all, this classic RPG remains a treat to pick up and play.",1

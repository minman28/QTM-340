"1","Makes the original look like the prototype it was. It's filled with a larger cast of characters vividly brought to life through brilliant writing and some of the best voice acting in video games...From the beginning of the single-player story to the end of the co-op mode, Portal 2 is a novel, unforgettable experience.",1
"2","Featuring the same kind of thrilling freedom of choice The Elder Scrolls series is known for along with beautiful visuals and a stirring soundtrack, playing Skyrim is a rare kind of intensely personal, deeply rewarding experience, and one of the best role-playing games yet produced.",1
"3","If the graphical boost isn't enough - and let's be honest, we're already seeing some games on the 3DS that look better than this - you're not going to have much else to satisfy your interests. It's clear this game is being released to find a new generation of gamers that are just discovering Nintendo's franchises. The rest of us will have to determine if it's worth re-visiting a Hyrule we've known for nearly 13 years.",1
"4","The voice acting, the challenges, the amazing opening, the unbelievable ending and the feeling of being the Dark Knight -- these are the things that standout looking back. I've beaten this thing twice and still want to call in sick and chase Riddler Trophies.",1
"5","With an expertly balanced difficulty progression, dazzling level design and masterful Power-Ups, this is the ideal 3DS experience...As a whole, 3D Land is brilliant and addictive, and should do for 3D-enhanced platforming what the original Super Mario Bros. did for 2D platforming. If you own a 3DS system, you have no choice - you simply must own this game.",1
"6","Human Revolution is a smart, rewarding piece of transhumanist noir that does justice not just to Deus Ex, but to the fiction that inspired it.",1
"7","Buy it. Love it. And get to work making some of your very own Pushmo, because I want to play them.",1
"8","Shogun 2 is an expertly tuned turn-based strategy game filled with exhilarating real-time tactical battles against a capable artificial intelligence or others online.",1
"9","DICE's adoration of and expertise with the online experience permeates every aspect of its multiplayer. Regardless of the narrative missteps or the occasional glitches, Battlefield 3 offers an unforgettable, world-class multiplayer suite that's sure to excite shooter fans, whether they fired their first bullet in Battlefield 1942 or have just now heeded Battlefield's call of duty.",1
"10","An incredible achievement. Very few games are as original, atmospheric, and consistently brilliant. It belongs in everybody's collection. The journey may be over too quickly, but you will be entertained every minute. This is one of my favorite games.",1
"11","The game doesn't advance the wider narrative very far, the new mechanics don't really add a great deal and the mission designs rarely explore new gameplay possibilities...That said, there's a lot to like; the game is undeniably solid, while the multiplayer offers a unique experience.",1
"12","The Witcher 2 is alternately offensive and endearing, grimy and gorgeous, and never ceases to surprise. It's one of the great titles of 2011, and one of the best role-playing games in years.",1
"13","The shocking moments, the gruesome deaths, and the fun of playing through this experience again and again are what I took away from this one.",1
"14","This game is amazing and you owe it to yourself to download it.",1
"15","It's a beautiful, engrossing experience that avoids the anemic, scripted playbook made law by the 500 pound shooter gorilla.",1
"16","In Dirt 3 a few scratches tarnish an otherwise impeccable product. It's a superb racing experience and shouldn't be missed.",1
"17","A great game. It's not only the best launch game for the Nintendo 3DS, but will certainly be regarded as a great purchase for years to come.",1
"18","The subtle tension that builds as strategic plans are hashed out and executed simultaneously on the battlefield is priceless, resulting in a fresh, chaotic experience you'll want to dive into over and over again.",1
"19","Though the character roster should have been larger, and a cheap blue shell can still screw up an otherwise perfect race, MK7 still offers enough innovation to keep this old formula feeling fresh. With memorable new tracks, well implemented gyro controls, the triumphant return of coins and a handful of new modes, Mario Kart 7 is full of win.",1
"20","A stand-out, wonderfully crafted MMO. The story elements deliver on every front, the vocal performances are excellent, and some genuinely clever innovations have been applied to PvP combat. There's also a massive volume of content to keep you hooked for a long time. But it's important to keep in mind that The Old Republic doesn't stray too far from standard MMO mechanics.",1
"21","Saints Row: The Third gives the people what they want and drops us into an open world adult theme park where we can treat ourselves to delightful acts of bloodshed and perversion. It doesn't take itself too seriously and only asks that you don't, either.",1
"22","Considering Super Street Fighter IV was never released on PC, the additions offered in the Arcade Edition are substantial.",1
"23","When a game is this colossal, this rich, it's hard to see how it could possibly be bettered, match engine excepted.",1
"24","As it is, it reminds me of avant-garde art or haute cuisine; interesting and bold but made for a small group of devoted connoisseurs. Those of a certain palate are sure to love its humor, weirdness and replayability but the broader gaming audience is likely to find it more of an acquired taste.",1
"25","Trine 2 throws players into a dazzling fantasy world and gives them three fun tools with which to save it. It's delightfully open-ended, from how you solve problems to whether or not you go it alone. Fans of puzzle games will not be disappointed.",1
"26","There's a steep learning curve, but once you're comfortable with what Rift offers, you will find a deeply immersive experience. Telara is a worthy alternative to Azeroth for anyone looking to explore a new world.",1
"27","A violent and immersive racer that recreates the driving experience like no other game on the market. In doing so it builds well on the first Shift's foundations, benefitting from Slightly Mad Studios' more refined touch and the inclusion of Autolog, but its handling is still too loose and its steps forward too small for it to truly beat Gran Turismo and Forza – although it does enough to ensure that it's pulled ever closer.",1
"28","Sure, I was lured in by Anno 2070's good looks, but its brains and depth that make this one a real beauty. She's a keeper.",1
"29","Orcs Must Die embellishes your devious side, encouraging you to devise clever ways of fulfilling the command of the title. For the not-so-clever, mowing down invaders with an automatic crossbow is also a great time.",1
"30","Though on the surface it looks like just another ""me too"" indie game seeking to ride the coattails of Minecraft's success, Terraria expands on the familiar sandbox gameplay with a greater emphasis on combat and adventure that proves very satisfying.",1
"31","The awesome performances and great facial capture make every interrogation and investigation a riveting affair.",1
"32","As it is, VVVVVV is still a spike-lined, death-packed good time. Its steeper price and wimpy 3D just make it feel like more of a straightforward PC port and less like something truly special for the eShop.",1
"33","A must-own for anyone who loves adventure games, with its stellar writing, gorgeous art, and quotable humor. Throw in the smooth interface, the lack of any normal issues of the genre, and its solid cast, it appeals to gamers of all skills and experience.",1
"34","A brilliant, touching game that is truly special, and that all gamers should make it a point to play.",1
"35","Having done all the writing, animation and programming himself, Gemini Rue took Josh Nuernberger a total of three years to make-the same amount of time it takes some triple-A titles to hit the shelves. If only more triple-A games turned out this well.",1
"36","The combat is more responsive and bloody, you don't need to fight the inventory system anymore, and conversations are more engaging thanks to the adapted Mass Effect wheel. There are downsides though; the semi-linear story and repetitive environments have a negative effect on what is otherwise a great role-playing game.",1
"37","Taken out of the context of its fiction, People Can Fly would have something fun but forgettable on their hands, but the way Bulletstorm fits together results in something cool and memorable.",1
"38","A great surprise. Sure, the gameplay formula is typical Fallout -- fetch quests, exploration, killing, and moral decision making -- but it's wrapped in a genuinely humorous package.",1
"39","The story is good enough to recommend this game despite its relatively weak gameplay.",1
"40","This impressive remake of Star Fox 64 manages to improve upon the original without compromising the magic that made it so memorable to begin with. It's too bad the multiplayer doesn't support online, because otherwise it's the perfect remake of this classic title.",1
"41","It's certainly not a game without its issues, but it's still a great title, and at $10, it's also a total steal.",1
"42","The level of polish found in the graphics and gameplay alike is outstanding for an indie title. Peculiar ideas and inventive mechanics make this quirky bullet-hell shooter a frenzied, fun affair.",1
"43","It's a game about community and sharing and Nadeo does a good job of wrapping up the whole of the Trackmania experience – local multiplayer, online competition, track and car editors and worldwide rankings – into one package.",1
"44","The PC version understandably has some varied controls when using a mouse and keyboard (though it plays just fine with intuitive use of the number keys).",1
"45","A clever twist on tower defense that will rope back in gamers that think they've had enough of the well-worn formula.",1
"46","There is a huge world to explore, thousands of zombies to kill, and tons of side quests to take. Here on the other side of a 25-hour playthrough -- where I skipped a lot of side quests after Act 1 -- I'm anxious to get back into Dead Island, and despite the game's flaws, that's not something I say often.",1
"47","It manages to straddle pure tank simulation and shooter action to produce something that, despite being flawed, remains genuinely fun.",1
"48","It makes warfare into something violently beautiful, and pays homage to the nerdy lore that Warhammer fans like me can't get enough of.",1
"49","It looks great, it's got a lot of personality, it tells an entertaining story and it's great fun to play. A few frustrating difficulty spikes and the story's rather premature ending are the only negatives.",1
"50","Another fine example of what a small development team can accomplish with enough ambition and talent. The game is good-looking, entertaining and boasts a fluidity of play many bigger games would envy.",1
"51","Weird cut-scenes and clunky use of the touch screen aside, this is a beautiful and fun game that fighter fans should make it a point to check out.",1
"52","Stunlock's game largely succeeds, and though it's not the prettiest piece of software on the planet, it's definitely one of the most entertaining.",1
"53","Dungeons of Dredmor's voluminous depths are littered with an abundance of wacky treasure to horde and enticing weaponry to cleaving all sorts of evil beasties in twain with.",1
"54","Despite the lack of genuinely exciting context, all the content packed into Rage is still a blast to play, including the surprisingly entertaining car combat mode and co-operative challenges. Rage isn't revolutionary, but is an expertly crafted, beautiful shooter.",1
"55","Pets puts the series and franchise back on track and continues to make its virtual worlds even more fleshed out. As always, this expansion isn't going to make any non-Sims player a convert, but if you're still enjoying your digital families, this is a good expansion to pick up.",1
"56","Mighty Switch Force is a great first effort from WayForward for Nintendo's 3DS, but it has its issues. The game lacks length, and its Par times will unnecessarily encourage players to rush through their first playthroughs – making the game seem even shorter and stealing away some of their sense of the success.",1
"57","Despite its flaws, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 takes the fantastic series we've come to love over the years and iterates on it with great success. The multiplayer is hands-down the best it has ever been, with more features, more modes and a ton of new levels. The singleplayer campaign and Spec Ops mode add value to the overall package, creating something that may not be perfect, but is too damn addicting to pass up.",1
"58","The innovative mix of various RPG sub-genres results in an intriguing and incredibly fun overall package. However, given the original came out so recently, it's rather confusing why this barely enhanced version even exists.",1
"59","I'm having a blast with Tropico 4, but I know it's not for everyone. Tracking stats, managing an economy and building a million projects at once keeps me engaged, but without a little patience to learn the interface it'll overwhelm many a strategy newcomer.",1
"60","Despite the disappointing multiplayer options, the clichéd characters, and the sometimes repetitious nature of the campaign, the strategy gameplay of Shadow Wars is fun enough to make it a worthy recommendation for any turn-based enthusiast.",0
"61","It feels refreshing to be able to say that Sonic is good again. His upward trajectory over the last year continues and he's only gaining momentum. Sonic Generations is largely a game for the most hardcore of Sonic fans, but for the millions who have fond memories of narrowly dodging spikes, grinding on rails, or even that time he was a pinball, Sonic Generations is a game made for you.",1
"62","I just wish they'd taken this project all the way, instead of stopping with ""good enough.""",1
"63","Prejudice certainly does a lot – it just doesn't do very much well.",0
"64","Might and Magic Heroes VI may have some issues with battlefield tactics in the late game and its story, but the strategy remains a blast nonetheless.",1
"65","It may be the closest thing to X-COM: UFO Defense we’ve seen in 20 years, but its frustrations make it tougher to recommend than it should be.",1
"66","This edition shows vast improvement.",1
"67","The Sims Medieval has successfully breathed new life into a franchise that was getting pretty stale.",1
"68","Memorable, beautiful and unique, something that stays in your mind long after you've moved on to something else.",1
"69","Most importantly, though, the various types of gameplay that the developers have thrown together may not be all that amazing on their own, but the elements work together to create a well-paced, easy-to-understand game that is good fun for anyone.",1
"70","In Red Orchestra 2 carelessness is swiftly punished and careful positioning and teamwork ultimately rewarded. It's a game for the patient, and despite its slower pace, no less exhilarating than any other shooter on the market.",1
"71","Who's That Flying?! is enjoyable, funny, and cute. The story mode kind of fell flat for me as each city's three levels felt similar and dragged a bit, but that's just a portion of the game.",1
"72","While the timer on my save read around 14 hours by the time I screamed and shouted and pushed my way through Two Worlds II's final (miserable, cheap, and poorly designed) boss encounter, I would put my play time in the neighborhood of 35 hours, at least. This is courtesy of Two Worlds II's propensity to greet exploration with quick, brutal death.",0
"73","It's beautiful, well-written and cleverly-designed and if its only flaws were a flaky scroll button and blurry cutscenes, it would warrant an unmitigated thumbs up.",1
"74","The[] ability to tear apart and repair the environments at will is a hook that keeps working, and when the campaign gives you plenty of stuff to tear apart it's easy to lose yourself to a primal need to destroy.",0
"75","With addictive gameplay, gorgeous and creative use of 3D, and some amazing new control options, portable gaming enthusiasts have no reason to pass this title up.",1
"76","It's funny, it clever, and it answers a lot of questions I had. I enjoyed playing it, but I didn't love it. The story isn't as grounded as I'd like it to be at certain points, so it throws the balance of sincere/goofy off. I wanted the conclusion of the serious movie feelings episode one started, but I got the comical ending of a Saturday morning cartoon.",0
"77","Though it has a few issues with regards to Blendo's reliance on randomization, such problems shouldn't turn you away if you're looking for an offbeat gaming experience.",1
"78","For a game that tries so hard to get under your skin, Fable III rarely manages to do much more than scratch the surface.",0
"79","Through questionable level design, graphical inconsistency, and repetitive gameplay, I was pulled out of the experience more than I would have liked. Alice: Madness Returns is a memorable peek through a flawed looking glass.",0
"80","The writing is really good in general (despite one tasteless bit of dialogue where Hector calls some gangsters ""homos"" instead of ""homies""), and the puzzles are fun, but don't expect anything out of the ordinary gameplay wise.",1
"81","It features familiar characters and setting but keeps everything fresh with new people, places and pacing.",1
"82","Axis' presentation just plain doesn't quite stack up to other versions on the market - most notable Tetris DS - and the uninspired use of Miis comes off as more lazy than fun.",1
"83","With a level-headed team of four, Magicka's cooperative action is entrancing chaos. It's rare for a game to feel this mechanically satisfying.",0
"84","It may not be the best or most original action game, but it's a fine first outing for the franchise, and a rare gem for Warhammer fans.",1
"85","Whether you're looking for a new, solid shooter to play or something set in a unique, horror-filled atmosphere, F.E.A.R. 3 has something for you. You won't find the be-all, end-all shooter experience with F.E.A.R. 3, but you're still bound to have a lot of fun.",1
"86","Remains fun despite its problems, and makes for some great local competitive play.",1
"87","There isn't a wealth of game here, but what is here is thoroughly enjoyable. Fortix 2 proves that, 30 years later, the Qix formula remains fun.",1
"88","It's great to have an opportunity to revisit Deus Ex: Human Revolution, and The Missing Link is a substantial, tense and exciting piece of downloadable content that's far more than just filler.",1
"89","Another great adventure game. If you want to get into a classic point-and-click adventure series, and are looking for something a bit more mature than many of TellTale's other titles, you have to try Hector.",1
"90","The disposable story and flat characters shouldn't be surprising for a game like this, but other issues like a the lack of enemy variety and short overall length are disappointing. Despite that, the versatility of the weapon system and flashy visuals make Flying Wild Hog's product exciting from beginning to end.",1
"91","It's a couple of features short of being a classic, but its compelling game of football has found a comfortable home on the handheld. It suggests that greater things are to come from this relationship, but there's enough here to keep players going until then.",1
"92","There's a lot more to both it and the original than a celestial bump and grind.",1
"93","Serious Sam 3: BFE will ultimately exhaust its players by virtue of its screen-filling mega-confrontations, its non-stop repetition and the sense that you are almost always mercilessly outgunned. Sam 3 is good but could have been better.",0
"94","An intriguing action puzzler that is as cute as it is challenging. While the campaign probably won't take you more than five or six hours to get through (and a lot less than that if you know what you're doing), the bonus levels and community levels will keep you entertained as long as you wish.",1
"95","DCUO is far from a bad game; there are indeed times when it shines fantastically with the potential for greatness, but its many faults, most minor but some quite large, ensure that it never reaches those heights.",0
"96","Gray Matter's winding story and masterful presentation captivate enough to hold everything together, particularly as the tale reaches its bizarre climax in the final chapters.",1
"97","A dungeon crawler with a boring loot table, poorly implemented multiplayer, and little lasting incentive to continue running around the world once the tedious story ends.",0
"98","I'm a fan of games that give you control of your character's life (see: buying houses, decorating, pimping sweet rides), but the driving is missing the raw energy it needs to stay interesting and the rest of the experience is bug-ridden.",0
"99","There's something kind of addictive about teaching your fake dog new tricks. For repeat customers, unless your kid is still playing the first game religiously, I don't see the upgraded version holding their interest for nearly as long.",0
"100","I dig the humor, the puzzles, the voicework and the setting. I think the story takes the characters to some goofy places in the end and I didn't feel like I'd accomplished much when everything was said and done, but that's far from a deal-breaker.",1
"101","There's something kind of addictive about teaching your fake dog new tricks. For repeat customers, unless your kid is still playing the first game religiously, I don't see the upgraded version holding their interest for nearly as long.",0
"102","There's something kind of addictive about teaching your fake dog new tricks. For repeat customers, unless your kid is still playing the first game religiously, I don't see the upgraded version holding their interest for nearly as long.",0
"103","It's just disappointing that the developers only added a handful of mostly inconsequential extra modes in the interim, and didn't take that extra time available to fix a few of the first versions' flaws.",0
"104","The 3D really is a big addition in this case, as well, allowing you to see environments more clearly and complete jumps that would otherwise be much more difficult. And with the small number of 3DS games on the market right now, you could certainly do worse than LEGO Pirates.",1
"105","Truly impressive just as it is, and it deserves the attention of any Nintendo fans who've either always been curious about this series or just love flying through the sky to blow stuff up.",1
"106","For its effective use of 3D gameplay and its simple yet refined design, PilotWings deserves a good deal of credit.",0
"107","There's a lot of talking and gathering things for other people. It's rather ho-hum.",0
"108","A fun and satisfying conclusion to TellTale's darkest adventure game franchise.",1
"109","Caught somewhere between massively-multiplayer online role-playing game and hardcore competitive real-time strategy, Age of Empires Online delivers some of the most addictive parts of both. Some sloppy mechanics and balance and reward issues detract from the core Age of Empires experience, but not to the point that it's not worth playing.",0
"110","Sanctum nicely upgrades Tower Defense genre but unfortunately doesn't dig much fun out of a good idea. [Issue#204]",0
"111","The lack of feedback, in-game competition, and unpredictability hurt the game's long-term draw; some older business simulations didn't have these problems. Cities in Motion does feature stellar tools and is one of the prettier business simulations on the market.",0
"112","An online shooter needs variety, depth, and addictiveness to succeed over the long term. Brink might find a niche with some hardcore fans, but it isn't for everyone. The PC version feels more complete than its console counterpart, but my qualms over content remain the same. Brink has heart, but the overall package is lacking.",0
"113","The majority of the new features introduced in The Sims 3: Generations are enjoyable enough to fiddle with, but none of them are major game changers.",0
"114","The content of Dead Money can get frustrating quickly. Still, for the patient souls out there, this fresh spin on Fallout is a decent buy.",0
"115","Sequence is sort of like serving someone a ham sandwich on a silver tray with all sorts of accoutrements. It's nice that it's a silver tray and not a paper plate, but I'm still eating a ham sandwich here.",0
"116","Homefront is certainly one of the most unique shooters I've ever played, driven by an ingenious and surprisingly well-fleshed out plot and a dark and dreary, realistic setting. But it also controls and feels like a typical shooter, looks like a game that's several years old, and most importantly, has an inexcusably brief campaign.",0
"117","What brings the game down considerably is the repetitiveness of the main combat, and the fact that the initially inspired level and art designs take a nosedive about halfway through.",1
"118","Q.U.B.E. offers some short-term fun for puzzle fans and not a lot else. With so little emphasis put on story I can't help but feel that Q.U.B.E. may have benefitted from having no story elements at all, instead of loosely hinting at some bigger picture that goes unseen.",0
"119","Delivers an interesting and fun variation of a traditional card game and turns it into a competitive puzzle with myriad nuances to its strategy. Unfortunately, it doesn't do enough to keep the variation fresh throughout.",0
"120","Terribly cheesy in all the right ways.",1
"121","And so it is that Freakyforms still leaves me scratching my head, even five months later. You're welcome to try it for yourself to see if you have better luck at understanding its madness, but I'd recommend most 3DS owners save the seven bucks to spend on surer bets.",0
"122","TwinBee is sort of fun and funny as it is.",0
"123","There's still a lot of good here, and if you haven't played Mount & Blade before then this is a fine place to start, but for fans of the series, Mount & Blade: With Fire and Sword simply isn't a must-have expansion.",1
"124","It's far from a perfect game -- inconsistent AI, a campaign that borders on the short side, and limited multiplayer options certainly hamper the experience -- but there's a lot of challenging satisfaction to be found beneath the thick jungle canopy.",0
"125","It all leaves me wondering why, at this point, anyone would choose to spend money on Play4Free when they could essentially get a larger, more complete game for just a few bucks more than the minimum Battlefunds purchase price.",0
"126","The flawed story mode can be safely passed by, but if you're able to find an opponent online or skirmish against the AI it's easier to appreciate Oil Rush's strengths.",0
"127","A surprisingly rich title for a handheld console. It's perfect for a quick game on tiresome commutes.",0
"128","I know a mediocre expansion when I see one, and this is a truly mediocre expansion, one not worth your money. Hold off until the price comes down or EA releases some sort of The Sims Medieval Gold Edition.",0
"129","In an age where everything is capable of online play, it just doesn't make sense for a franchise famous for its cooperative play to be single player only. Still, it'd be a great distraction for kids, who are less likely to be annoyed by the repetitive level design.",0
"130","It's merely capable, with occasional flashpoints of brilliance.",1
"131","Whereas the console version of Sonic Generations is a blending of old and new mentality in a fast-paced speed fest, the 3DS version is mostly just a Sonic Rush game where both playable characters happen to be Sonic.",0
"132","While it's admirable that the team had opted to create an original story set alongside the events in the books, you'll wish that they had attempted to take more risks with the project. The characters are bland and lifeless, and the combat, while fun at first, gets pretty repetitive before too long.",0
"133","The narrative could be stronger and there's a lack of variety in terms of creatures occupying the park, but these are minor complaints about an otherwise enjoyable time.",1
"134","It's like an interactive coloring book made by a 10 year old obsessed with Mastodon.",0
"135","A fun but deceptively shallow Sim-RPG-thing that would have benefitted from pushing the envelope for either genre a little more.",0
"136","The vast amount of customization options and the simple but fun battle system kept me interested enough to overlook the poor execution of story.",0
"137","Despite its considerable flaws, at its core, Mercenaries is a ton of fun. From the moment I started playing it I couldn't put it down.",0
"138","Hoard is a refreshing little multiplayer game that lets you be the bad guy for a change. Designed for short matches against other players, it's a somewhat limited experience, but burninating the countryside is definitely a lot of fun.",1
"139","Cargo! The Quest for Gravity could have been an unforgettable game title; unfortunately, due to poorly-conceived vehicle controls, unclear objectives and some serious technical issues, what's bound to stick in your mind is the frustration of playing it.",0
"140","Sure, it's not very deep from an RPG-elements perspective, nor does it have the kind of story that's going to make you go ""Hm!"", but it will entertain you and help whet your appetite for the monster-stomping extravaganza that will be Serious Sam 3.",0
"141","Purchasing Arrival means there's more to do in Mass Effect 2, and that's always a good thing. It sets up the tone of urgency that's prevalent in the Mass Effect 3 trailer, but don't expect it to explain a lot. If you don't mind combat-focused, linear missions, it's worth the $7.",0
"142","An incredibly strong debut for 3DSWare. Grab this one quickly, 3DS owners, and start recapturing some of that old Mario Golf magic.",1
"143","Chantelise could have been a tight little RPG were it better balanced and not so keenly intent on punishing the player. With more grind than game, it quickly devolves into a pointless, repetitive drill that would test the patience of all but the most determined gamer.",0
"144","While Gabrielle's Ghostly Grooves 3D provides a creative, memorable world full of lovable characters, the gameplay itself comes off as kind of run-of-the-mill. Still, if you love rhythm games, Ghostly Grooves brings enough personality, laughs and fun to make it well worth your time.",1
"145","For the price it's not bad for being a multiplayer-only title, it's just that nothing about Breach is particularly noteworthy.",0
"146","The entire time I was playing, I felt ripped off. I'd been suckered into thinking I would be getting something new and dazzling and instead, I ran into the same problems I had 11years ago. Don't bother with this rehash on 3DS.",0
"147","It's odd blend of cover-based shooting, a fantasy setting, and hot co-op action make it an eyebrow-raiser, but the execution is flawed.",0
"148","E.Y.E. is an ambitious game from a small team, and has moments where it shines, but it ultimately isn't all that fun.",0
"149","If you don't expect much from it, you'll have a pretty good time with Venetica. However, without the patience to figure out quests and gameplay elements on your own, you'll end up incredibly frustrated.",0
"150","Innovative and somewhat unique but ultimately repetitive to the point of boredom and at times just plain annoying, Off-Road Drive, as it stands, simply isn't a good game.",0
"151","Pyramids isn't the most original game and nothing about it will surprise or amaze you too much, but it's done well overall and a good value for its asking price.",1
"152","There's one hell of a game in there, trying to escape. And I think, given the responsiveness and the past track record of the development team and the plans that lie ahead in the next few months, that escape will soon occur.",0
"153","A $40 asking price for Pac-Man & Galaga Dimensions is far too high for such a mediocre collection.",0
"154","At this point, InMomentum isn't really worth its asking price. While its limited, nostalgia-tinged take on platform racing gets the entertainment wheels turning, its repetitive game modes and at times awkward mechanics prevent it from ever getting up to speed.",0
"155","F1 experts have probably already been racing their way through the home console versions of this title since September. With the 3DS version's odd A.I., it's hard to recommend that Formula fans give this edition a go. Codemasters knows racing -- but when they pass off portable development to other teams, you've got to be wary.",0
"156","The massive character customization also makes your faery or elf feel unique, so if you enjoy leveling up and finding loot, you should check out Faery: Legends of Avalon.",0
"157","Well executed, but lacking in depth (which is ironic for a multitude of reasons). However, once you give it a fair shot, you'll be surprised how addictive the gameplay is and how much fun you'll have trying to master the controls and conquer each mission.",0
"158","Xevious is still a game design that's nearly 30 years old, so all the new bells and whistles in the world won't be enough to get some modern fans interested in this old classic again. But the 3D Classics upgrades have made me more of a fan of it than I ever was before, and that's certainly enough for me to recommend you all give it a try too.",1
"159","Aside from its uninspired combat and limited scope, Pirates of Black Cove is an endearing game at times. I wanted to love it, and kept diving back in hoping that something would click. It didn't.",0
"160","If simple fun and the inclusion of Pokemon is all you're looking for, then Rumble Blast is the game for you. Otherwise, there are much more deserving 3DS titles to spend your hard-earned cash on.",0
"161","A stellar action puzzle hybrid with tight controls, Monkey Ball 3D is the best Monkey Ball game since the original, and Sega's found some cool ways to implement the system's 3D functionality and make it relevant to the gameplay.",1
"162","Thor 3DS still offers a passable brawler for fans of the genre at its most basic, but if you're looking for the next great portable game, you best look elsewhere.",0
"163","An aesthetically gorgeous game with a really interesting premise that just never finds its legs.",0
"164","It's a muddled, hypocritical exercise in irritation with solid shooting mechanics and decent encounter design. There's some dumb fun to be had in Duke Nukem Forever, but the game tries hard to ensure it's only fleeting.",0
"165","I wouldn't call Jurassic Park a bad game as it works and does take us back to a time when dinosaurs (stiffly) roamed the Earth, but the story, animations and general gameplay keep it from being able to contend with most titles on the market -- and that includes other Telltale titles.",0
"166","Injecting dynamic time travel into a real-time strategy game is a risky, ambitious move. Though it takes a lot of effort, experimentation, and agonizing in order to use the time travel mechanics effectively, Hazardous Software manages to pull it off. The problem is the rest of the game suffers from design flaws and technical issues, making Achron feel like an RTS relic.",0
"167","A Game of Thrones: Genesis's sluggish campaign further suffers from poor pacing, and the end game almost always devolves into ham-fisted warfare punctuated by dull combat – one of its weakest facets.",0
"168","Despite its many shortcomings, Splinter Cell 3D is still fun to play. And that's what matters most. It's not even close to being as good as Chaos Theory on Xbox, but then again, I couldn't play that on a plane. If the AI were even passable and not laughable, this would be an easier recommendation.",0
"169","If a game's multiplayer mechanics are strong enough to support it, story isn't necessarily a must-have. Here however, awkward mechanics and skewed difficulty ultimately hamstring The Haunted: Hells Reach, and make you wish there was something more to hold it up.",0
"170","Cubic Ninja could have been an amazingly addictive game, but some faulty controls and a lack of content hold it back. It's still a fun experience, but for such a high price tag it's not really worth the investment.",0
"171","Captain America fans should only buy this game if they're willing to put up with clunky gameplay and mediocre presentation.",0
"172","It's a step down from Shattered Dimensions, offering a less interesting plot, fewer Spider-Men to play as, and less fan service. As a finished product it just feels rushed.",0
"173","The story is where the game had an advantage, but unfortunately it drops the ball with the weird narration, lack of dialogue, and limited cutscenes.",0
"174","I was most disturbed by the game's complete lack of multiplayer functionality, and the inexcusable state of its season mode, the two things that are the biggest draws in today's Madden franchise. It should go without saying that you should pass on this rushed iteration of Madden.",0
"175","While 1C Company should be congratulated for being ambitious enough to put forth the effort to recreate in minute detail, one of the most pivotal events of the Cold War, they should perhaps be admonished for not being ambitious enough.",0
"176","Bust-A-Move Universe has some serious negative sides (like being way too short and having no multiplayer), but the core gameplay is as solid as ever.",0
"177","Passion alone isn't enough to make a game great. Stronghold 3 assumes too much of the user initially, and doesn't do enough to keep the village-building fresh and interesting.",0
"178","I love the concept for Combat of Giants: Dinosaurs. It's brilliant. I wish the game lived up to that though. More varied gameplay, a longer career that got challenging, and multiplayer are all sorely missing.",0
"179","The game lacks variety, but it also doesn't outstay its welcome. If you want some laughs and don't mind that the shooting experience is average at best, playing through this alien invasion is probably more entertaining than the movie and you'll get some Achievements/Trophies out of it.",0
"180","It's hard to imagine anyone not being offended by Postal III. That's a big selling point for some folks, but the uninspired gameplay and serious technical glitches all but kill this dark, occasionally humorous, and extreme exercise in freedom of expression.",0
"181","While the game doesn't do much of note besides bringing the 2008 title to the HD era, it doesn't need to. The story hooks you, dungeon crawling makes for a great time, and exploring your relationships while building a better army is the kind of tinkering you can get lose hours to.",1
"182","It's a shame that Dishonored's story isn't greater than the sum of its decidedly memorable parts, but its gameplay absolutely is.",1
"183","ArenaNet has built one of the most exhaustively detailed and rewarding MMOs in existence, one that never unfairly penalizes and fosters an incredible urge to explore through a generous reward system and achingly pretty environment design.",1
"184","Using player choice, award-winning writing, and your own emotions, The Walking Dead: The Game delivers an experience that's flawed but unforgettable.",1
"185","A perfectly paced finale to a story we've all been invested in from the get go.",1
"186","The one thing worth pointing out between the various platforms is how cool Borderlands 2 can look if you have an awesome PC. The PC version allows plenty of tweaks to draw distance, frame rate and more.",1
"187","You're still likely to want a bit more depth and surprise in the tactical game, but the campaign is full of tense moments that are sure to keep you coming back for more.",1
"188","An absolutely amazing game, one that successfully puts a bow on the Mass Effect trilogy while still leaving us hungry for even more. It looks and plays great, but Mass Effect 3's true strength lies in its ability to tell a deeply-woven story.",1
"189","With plenty of options, great tutorials and an easy-to-master interface, Colors! 3D is the 3D painting application 3DS owners have been waiting for.",1
"190","Far Cry 3 is important for the same reason as Far Cry 2. It's a shooter that considers shooters thoughtfully, both in the way they're designed and the way we play them, and then asks us to do the same.",1
"191","Rayman Origins takes on a genre mastery of ground work laid down decades ago and elevates it to astronomical new standards. It's a spectacular living painting that's as much fun to play as it is to look at, and it's a total triumph.",1
"192","Torchlight II doesn't do anything radically new, but does everything incredibly well. It fits all the pieces of varied monster behavior, interesting items, excellent skill design and random surprises together into a near-perfect formula, where the action never stops and rewards are never far away.",1
"193","Thirty Flights of Loving gets off to a fascinating start before completely throwing any and all expectations you might form during its first few minutes into the wood chipper.",1
"194","So many systems from previous Diablo titles have been improved, making for an approachable, rewarding and deeply satisfying treasure hunting game. It's addictive on a level few games can match, so much so that it's easy to largely overlook its flaws.",1
"195","The definitive LittleBigPlanet game...Yes, the jumping is still floaty, the creation complicated and the load times a bit too long, but that doesn't stop LittleBigPlanet PS Vita from being an amazing experience.",1
"196","Like any good expansion – even standalone expansion – it doesn't just add things to the original, it changes them. You'll get an experience much more like a Civil War-era wargame with Fall of the Samurai, as opposed to a medieval wargame with the original Shogun 2, and that, in itself, is worth the cost of admission, let alone all the new units, locations, abilities, factions, and bells/whistles.",1
"197","Football Manager's relentless strive for realism is sometimes its biggest fault, but with new modes and now new ways of playing it's also managed to get that light touch back.",1
"198","If you're a fan of the sport or FIFA in general, it's hard to imagine a game that you'll enjoy more this year.",1
"199","Even with its relatively minor flaws, anyone with even a cursory interest in Tribes: Ascend should play it. No other shooter conveys the same sense of speed – or the rush of pleasure that comes from nailing someone at over 100 KPH – as Tribes.",1
"200","It's downright gorgeous and a total blast to play alone or with friends. A truly realized vision at the top of its genre, Rayman Origins is an extravaganza with plenty of action to keep it fresh from start to finish and beyond.",1
"201","The puzzles are clever and addictive, and the new sliding mechanic, new gadgets and updated camera controls do a bang-up job of making this experience feel fresh and distinct. This game is a must download for any 3DS owner, especially fans of the puzzle genre.",1
"202","Tales from Space: Mutant Blobs Attack stole my heart. It's visually delicious, the cutscenes ooze with humor, and the actual gameplay feels perfectly balanced.",1
"203","Mass Effect 3 on its own is still easily one of the best games of the year – and some (like me) would argue that it's the best game in the trilogy – and that hasn't changed on Wii U. The only thing that's changed is your access to the rest of the series.",1
"204","Playing Assassin's Creed III on Wii U's Game Pad is a tad disappointing -- it looks a bit low-res compared to other console ports.",1
"205","It deserves to be played.",1
"206","Not once when you die does Dark Souls help you back up, not once does it let up in its astonishing quality or turn to padding, and not once do the ideas stop coming. Buy it.",1
"207","The few Wii U-exclusive options are hardly worth double-dipping over if you've already bought it for another console, though, and odds are you won't use them much regardless.",1
"208","The RPG elements and to-the-point action all make for some solid gaming, glitches and all. It's a shame so many glaring issues hold such an ambitious endeavor back from the greatness its developers were clearly aiming for.",1
"209","If this is your first time experiencing Netherrealm's MK reboot or simply didn't get your fill last year, then you'll find a ton of great content here.",1
"210","Batman: Arkham City isn't perfect, but listing the little things I didn't like gets in the way of all the stuff I adored.",1
"211","The scale of PlanetSide 2's battles is often breathtaking, as lines of tanks fire at bases while aircraft light up the sky and hundreds of players fill the scene with healing beams and lethal weapons fire.",1
"212","Connection problems and online funkiness aside, Sound Shapes absolutely floored me. Just about everything it does – and with its grand aesthetic taken as a whole – will blow you away.",1
"213","The visuals are lavishly detailed, with an organic, living beauty that you can choose to view either on your TV or off – the whole game can be played solely on the GamePad if you choose.",1
"214","FTL's situations lack some variety and the randomness of the game as a whole can be frustrating, but it largely makes up for these flaws through its intense combat and intuitive and deep micromanagement options.",1
"215","Nintendo's approach here strikes a great balance in all areas, ranging from its difficulty to design to enemies and bosses.",1
"216","There should be no timeline ever created that doesn't contain you playing this game.",1
"217","The game is simply addicting, both in its arresting, fast-paced action and its ability to inspire repeat visits with its scalable difficulty, bite-sized mentality and seemingly endless amount of unlockable content.",1
"218","So, while the Wii U version of Tekken Tag Tournament 2 doesn't change up many of the problems that we had with its original release, it adds some more casual-friendly modes for the Nintendo crowd.",1
"219","Load times could be a bit shorter and I wouldn't mind seeing the price come down, but Lumines: Electronic Symphony is amazing. It's the simple puzzle game we've known for a while coupled with new mechanics like the shuffle block and the Vita's connectivity.",1
"220","It never loses sight of the singular imperative to kill as many orcs as possible, and while there's a sense that too much has been recycled from the first outing, its unique combination of tower defense and action mechanics reach near perfection here. A qualified triumph for veterans of the first game and newcomers alike.",1
"221","Though the camera can cause issues and the supernatural story that's more interested in asking questions than answering them, it's a tough game to put down once you've started. Remedy's done a great job of mixing elements of written work, television, and videogames to create an experience full of scares, laughs, and thrills that's just as fun to play as it is to watch.",1
"222","I love Kat and totally dig most of the superhero story, but the cumbersome combat in latter missions definitely had me cursing at my handheld.",1
"223","Sword & Sworcery masterfully blends music, art, storytelling and gameplay in deeply poetic ways that you just don't see very often. As such, it doesn't take a love of adventure games to get wrapped up in the magic of this indie gem.",1
"224","This is a demanding, skill-based multiplayer game that's as satisfying now as it ever was, but it's for a specific kind of player. If you're not willing to learn to play different than you're used to, look elsewhere. Otherwise, this is a top-tier tactics game that will probably share the long-tailed legacy of its predecessors.",1
"225","Wading through BlazBlue: Continuum Shift Extend's massive vocabulary and doubly complex battle systems will demand time and patience from any gamer. But the cast powering this engrossing fighter makes all the effort worthwhile, and the huge variety of modes dresses up play in different ways.",1
"226","A great handheld game, one that not only pushes the boundaries and standards of the Nintendo 3DS but one that recaptures a long-forgotten spirit of a classic franchise. Make no mistake about it, this is a full Resident Evil adventure that isn't watered down because it's in portable form.",1
"227","Offers a gorgeous visual presentation, an intriguing story and incredible puzzle design - all in one of the most charming gaming worlds out there.",1
"228","Looks beautiful, runs well, totes short load times and has a great soundtrack. That's all well and good, but what makes the game so damn good is its addicting, twitch dual analog gameplay. Something tells me that many a PlayStation Vita gamer will have an incredibly hard time putting down Super Stardust Delta, if not for the gameplay then for the hyper-competitive nature of the leaderboards.",1
"229","If you've been meaning to check out the series, but never have, then Rebellion is the perfect entry point. However, if you've been a loyal fan, you're likely to be disappointed by the tweak-first, content-second approach that Rebellion offers.",1
"230","Everything about this well-crafted romp through deadly dungeons comes together to pull you into its mysterious realm and hold on.",1
"231","If for some reason you absolutely cannot stand its sense of humor, you may want to think twice, because it's as prevalent and over-the-top as ever here. Otherwise, Mr. Torgue's Campaign of Carnage represents Borderlands 2 at its distilled, unapologetic best.",1
"232","One of the surprising things about Crusader Kings II is that, for a Paradox title, it's actually relatively easy to pick up.",1
"233","The best questing in World of Warcraft, with strong emphasis on storytelling, resulting in an entertaining run from 85 to 90 that seldom tumbles into tedium.",1
"234","It has a believable cast of characters and a great look. Sure, the puzzles some adventure gamers love are missing and there will be an audio hiccup here and there, but as an introductory hook to the five-episode series, The Walking Dead Episode 1 has just about everything fans could want.",1
"235","Titles like Botanicula are why the point-and-click adventure genre continues to exist. It may not be as hilarious as adventure games of yesteryear, but it's persistently delightful, oozing character and grabbing hold of the imagination.",1
"236","New Art Academy is an improvement on the original, with more thorough, detailed lessons and a wider range of options, though it's also a missed opportunity.",1
"237","The RPG elements and to-the-point action all make for some solid gaming, glitches and all. It's a shame so many glaring issues hold such an ambitious endeavor back from the greatness its developers were clearly aiming for.",1
"238","Embrace it on its own terms, and you'll find a game that comes the closest a survival horror game has come to replicating the experience of the first Silent Hill game in recent years; indeed, in some ways, it's even better.",1
"239","Level for level, gun for gun, the campaign, multiplayer and zombies content of Black Ops 2 on Wii U is almost the same. This version may cut the livestreaming feature, and currently doesn't have Elite, but it makes up for it with some nifty GamePad functionality.",1
"240","It's independent, and the journey isn't always smooth. But cookie-cutter it is not, nor is it garish or sexist or silly or mindless. If you are a patient person who appreciates grey matter workouts and ""Eureka"" moments, and if you are willing to forgive imperfections, check it out. Gaming needs titles and developers like this.",1
"241","No matter what you're looking for, whether it be amazing gameplay, immersive storytelling or perhaps a riveting new world to explore as you fully customize and re-customize your character at will, Reckoning has it all.",1
"242","Packed with content, and it's a joy to play. Whether you're returning to Snake's adventures or experiencing them for the first time, these two games feel at home on the Vita, look great and will keep you busy for quite some time.",1
"243","It's fun, competitive, and features short sessions that normally last under a half-hour. If you're an RTS gamer looking for a new battlefield, you'll definitely want to give Wargame a try.",1
"244","Gods and Kings enhances the base game immensely, so much so that I can't imagine playing Civilization V without it.",1
"245","So Mighty Switch Force: Hyper Drive Edition doesn't go as far as it could have gone in remastering the 3DS original, but the changes that are present here are superb – veterans will love the challenge of the new Hyper levels, and the quality of the high-definition art is so good that it'd be worthwhile to buy the game on looks alone.",1
"246","The result is a game that is neither simulation nor arcade but a subtle blend of the two, with a control system about as deep as an arcade fighter.",1
"247","The game is great and an impressive launch title for the PlayStation Vita. It's just that the Uncharted series has been known for being a story-driven experience, and Golden Abyss goes in another direction. It's a beautiful, fun game with tons of collectibles, plenty of laughs, and some cool twists on a franchise PlayStation fans know so well. It's just not an instant classic like the other entries in the series.",1
"248","The PC version has the technical edge on console versions and is therefore a slightly improved experience, but other than that it's got all the same triumphs and flaws: it isn't as huge an improvement upon its predecessors' achievements as many players will be hoping for, but it's still up there with the best that the series has achieved. Even if it isn't quite the best.",1
"249","Mutant Mudds is a fitting homage to the 8-bit era of gaming. It's got lots of personality, and though its gameplay may be a bit too simplified, the clever, challenging levels still provide plenty of good times.",1
"250","Natural Selection 2 isn't great only because it's different, but because it does asymmetrical multiplayer so damn well, offering up a variety of experiences in one small game.",1
"251","No, Captain's Booty is not an exceptional follow-up to Borderlands 2, but it is a good piece of content that gives plenty of reasons for anyone to jump back into Pandora.",1
"252","A fast-paced, well playing fighter that makes few concessions on the Vita. While the game's modes are pretty sparse and the new touch mode is a dud, there's still a lot to be excited about if you're a fighting fan with a brand new Vita.",1
"253","Newcomers will find F1 2012 a shock to the system compared to more conventional racing games, but the ample tools provided to get into the sport provide a gratifying experience with just a little bit of commitment on the player's part.",1
"254","The artful way the characters' abilities allow you to move through the environment are entrancing, and the meticulously crafted levels create moments that made me look and feel awesome.",1
"255","There are a few compromises here and there, but they're negligible. The addition of touchpad shooting and the less successful touchscreen passing transform FIFA Vita into a very different experience – it's more fun, more jubilant, and accessible.",1
"256","For us, it's all about the sweet science, and in this regard SFxT is still sorely lacking.",0
"257","Something of an uncanny experience. A lot of the experience remains intact but its vitality has been drained away. It's a muted affair, and that ultimately harms a game that derives so much of its charm from those little touches.",0
"258","It's good, chaotic fun and has a baseline level of quality and polish that's pleasing to see. If this is your first Wipeout game, chances are you'll have a blast. For veterans, however – especially those schooled in the delights of HD and Fury – this game just isn't as smooth in feel or as elegant in design.",0
"259","Above everything, Absolution is a game that wants you to experiment with it. It refuses to be rushed through, rewarding brains over brawn.",1
"260","It's an accurate and impressive pinball simulator that controls well and has some great 3D visuals. If you have any interest in pinball the way it was originally meant to be played, or are looking to get into the pastime, Zen Pinball 3D should be right up your alley.",1
"261","Little Inferno looks nice, tells a unique story and will perhaps be seen by some as a triumph in experimental design. But it's not really a video game, so feel free to forget this freaky fireplace.",0
"262","Like its competition, Chivalry hasn't quite perfected the formula for medieval warfare, but it's a violent, fun time nonetheless.",1
"263","It's with the addition of Dimensions that Trion Worlds really breaks new ground, providing players with a powerful tool to create truly unique constructions.",1
"264","It's the racing game for people who don't tend to like racing games. You're not punished for missing that apex or abandoning that nagging racing line.",1
"265","Despite a dearth of immediately obvious changes, Baldur's Gate has aged well, and new players will find many hours' worth of fun if they approach it with an understanding of its increasingly antiquated framework.",1
"266","A great game - one worthy of your attention, particularly if you've never played it.",1
"267","It's by no means perfect – the inclusion of proper online multiplayer would've added another point – but you'd be hard-pushed to find a game as good as this for the price. If Motorstorm RC is an indication of the kind of quality gaming Vita will offer at such an attractive price then maybe Vita does have what it takes to stay the distance.",1
"268","Although the RPG elements feel a bit wasted, the varied gameplay options, scaled difficulty settings, and plethora of unlockable goodies still make for an excellent rhythm experience.",1
"269","So Fluidity: Spin Cycle feels like a hardware/gameplay mismatch on the 3DS, and the awkwardness of its controls keep it from ranking as one of the portable eShop's best purchases.",0
"270","Its individual elements suffer from a ""jack of all trades"" mediocrity, but they combine to form a whole that hints at greatness without ever quite achieving it. But thanks to a set of mod tools included in the release, it's possible the devoted community itself can push it up that final step.",1
"271","Amid a sea of sloppy ports, the Wii U version Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed shines like a veritable beacon: with the possible exception of Tekken Tag Tournament 2 it's the best multiplatform title on the console, and might just have the edge over the PS3 and 360 versions of the game, not least because offline play is now available for five players instead of four.",1
"272","The nature of the system makes for more forgiving ventures into the depths of the game's item worlds and the pixel art may be easier to forgive on the smaller screen. Platform aside, this was already an excellent turn-based strategy game that, although too heavy on frivolous exposition, can be explored and enjoyed from here to eternity.",1
"273","It is impossible not to be drawn in by the simple perfection of New Super Mario Bros 2's mechanics and level design – this is as pleasurable and effortless as 2D platforming gets. But it's also impossible not to be disappointed that it's over so quickly, and doesn't offer anything really new.",1
"274","A brilliant show of what Nintendo's new console and tablet controller are capable of, and has far more depth and content then you'd expect from a mini-game collection.",1
"275","The understated aesthetic design and unusual co-op puzzles will absorb you for the game's duration – the wit and personality of the writing, though, will stay with you for much longer.",1
"276","Quantum Conundrum's inventive puzzles put your brain to satisfying work. Everything surrounding the challenges feels a little empty and could use some of the rest of the game's ingenuity. But a disappointing ending and lack of visual detail shouldn't keep you from the thrill of inter-dimensional puzzle solving.",1
"277","A smart, polished and intelligent game of countless permutations. Its strength lies in how carefully and how cleverly it's balanced, as well as how it rewards all kinds of playing styles. We haven't seen a strategy game quite like this in a while.",1
"278","The new features don't add a lot to the package, making it hard to recommend Virtua Tennis to anyone that has been playing it on the console.",1
"279","The third episode of Penny Arcade Adventures looks and plays different than its predecessors, and the new direction is one worth rallying behind.",1
"280","It may not end up being the best shooter of 2012, but it could very well be the one that makes you feel the most powerful.",1
"281","ZombiU has so many great ideas from looting with the Wii U GamePad to permadeath to its spooky setting, but none of them grow into a great game. Controls are clunky, melee combat is annoying, and the game doesn't look good.",0
"282","Tera's an action-MMO that nails the ""action"" part and then manages a face-palm-inducing face-plant on all the other bits.",0
"283","I'm nearly 80 puzzles into Dokuro, and I'm still having a blast. In fact, it's been hard to put down.",1
"284","There's still plenty of life in the genre, as this creative romp amply demonstrates, even if fully appreciating it takes more patience than some will be able to muster.",0
"285","With its fast-paced action, compelling use of the 3D effect, nearly 100 different levels to conquer and compelling multiplayer mode, this puzzle game is an absolutely stunning addition to the 3DS eShop.",1
"286","Miasmata is unlike anything I've played. It makes the very act of survival an intense learning experience, and manages to do so without beating you over the head with lengthy tutorials.",1
"287","A major step up from the PSP versions. It's nearly the same game as the console. The touchscreen controls are a nice addition. It's a smaller, slightly less polished version of the game, but still an awesome baseball experience, and one of the best portable sports games ever.",1
"288","Has a nice, colorful approach to golf and a respectable set of multiplayer options. But the disconnect between the amount of time required to plan a shot and the milliseconds needed to mess it all up sparks ample frustrations.",0
"289","Grumbles about the frustrating matchmaker aside, Super Monday Night Combat is a free-to-play game that would have been a perfectly legitimate retail release with a few more maps and available Pros.",1
"290","Dear Esther is that rarest of things: a truly interesting game. It left me feeling pensive, mildly saddened, and confident that games have plenty of directions left to explore. If you're interested in what can be achieved when you abandon the conventions of games and explore the fringes of the form instead, it's a must-play.",1
"291","It's the right length to keep from feeling too repetitive, though I'd still have enjoyed it a lot more if the types of tasks I had to do had evolved in ways beyond cut, push, pull, repeat, or if the story had been more heavily implemented.",1
"292","The Wii U drops the physics, but it adds some nifty GamePad functionality. Nintendo's version could run smoother, though.",1
"293","Lilli's cute flavor of insanity makes her an intriguing character to play as, but she can't carry the plot of Harvey's New Eyes alone. The rest of the cast is so underdeveloped, the environments you explore so banal and uninteresting looking, that it's hard to appreciate Lilli's character or the smart puzzle design.",0
"294","Despite some dips in overall puzzle difficulty this time around, the game has a massive amount of content to both discover and create from scratch.",1
"295","It's impressive that Namco-Bandai has managed to port a full-sized, voice-acted Japanese RPG to the 3DS without sacrificing any of the content from the PlayStation 2 version. But it's also a six-year-old game that hasn't aged well in all respects, and if you're a North American Tales fan, it's likely to be one you've played before.",0
"296","The game's infectious spirit and sense of humour is irresistible, and it's big, too – you're not beating this one in a weekend. It's just a shame that putting stickers at the heart of the game didn't turn out to be the master-stroke it so readily could have been.",1
"297","An enjoyable experience with an engaging story and incredible characterization. Although the platforming is far from fluid and the story can feel convoluted at times, when KH3D soars, it soars high - capturing that KH magic that has propelled the series to great success for a decade now.",1
"298","It's hard to deny the value of buying a pool game on Vita and getting its PlayStation 3 counterpart as an added bonus. And graphically, Hustle Kings looks really nice. So despite the odd musical choices, spooky floating cue, bad connectivity, and annoying precision camera, Hustle Kings is still a good game.",0
"299","Great shooting mechanics and deep customization options make for an addictive combination, and its free-to-play model makes it easy to jump into with no upfront cost.",1
"300","In light of its technical flaws, we'd only cautiously recommend buying it on Vita. If you own a PS3, Xbox 360 or Wii U, you'd be better off with any of those versions, while those seeking a fast-paced racer that really makes their Vita sing should consider WipEout 2048 ahead of this.",0
"301","Its skillful blend of witty writing, fun shooting, and tactical tower defense makes for hours of replayable gameplay. Take into account the loot grind that Iron Brigade inspires, and the online co-op, and Double Fine's created a title I hope turns into a franchise.",1
"302","It doesn't reach the near perfect balance between character-driven story and tense gameplay that past pieces of DLC have, but it does tell a story that changes the Mass Effect universe forever.",1
"303","More variety in the graphics and gameplay modes would have helped, but for those who want to listen to music on a long flight, for example, Symphony provides an excellent way to enhance that experience and get a little gaming satisfaction on the way.",0
"304","It starts off slow – too slow – but if you give it time and work with it, A New Beginning may become one of your favorite installments in this series so far.",1
"305","Its tools are flexible enough to allow you to create a huge variety of monsters and levels, and it’s easy to get addicted to its sometimes-frustrating-but-always-gratifying levels. Few games have the creative flair – both in visuals and design – of Incredipede.",1
"306","There's just not much about Snapshot, graphically, gameplay-wise, or in any other way, that makes it stick out from the pack.",0
"307","The Secret World flirts with brilliance and – at least, during earlier zones – looks primed to seal the deal. But, as time goes on, its its seemingly bottomless bag of tricks starts to look a bit shallow.",0
"308","Sakura Samurai: Art of the Sword is a gorgeous game, and a brilliant addition to the 3DS library. The art style and music transport you to another world, and the combat is more than engaging.",1
"309","If you don't let yourself get too tripped up by the sometimes convoluted combat controls, then this charming, well-crafted platforming bloodfeast will really sink its fangs into you -- in a good way.",1
"310","The real strength of When Vikings Attack is its humor. It doesn't take itself seriously, and provides a nice change of pace from the deluge of first-person shooters and bloody action games we're all becoming more accustomed to. But its gameplay won't hook you for more than a passing few hours.",0
"311","By rights, Alan Wake's American Nightmare should be utterly underwhelming. The core game is changed not at all from its parent's lukewarm style, the story is thin and hackneyed, hell it even has live-action cutscenes. But somehow, the gameplay is challenging enough to keep you clicking that left mouse button and listening to that weird, not quite Rod Serling voice telling you to survive until morning just one more time.",1
"312","Despite some dips in overall puzzle difficulty this time around, the game has a massive amount of content to both discover and create from scratch.",1
"313","It's a solid gateway expansion that builds on the rules without overwhelming you, but still adds enough variety that you'll never want to play without it.",1
"314","It's a fantastic set of options, even if the modes themselves aren't too out of the ordinary, with classic, deathmatch and fort to choose from.",1
"315","The idea of rotating orbits and fantastic aesthetics make Unstoppable Gorg feel striking and unique to start, but the rest of the game doesn't live up to that great first impression.",0
"316","War of the Roses isn't quite Mount and Blade or Battlefield, but it manages to walk a fine line between the two models to produce an innovative and enjoyable experience.",0
"317","The interplay between Horatio and Crispin as they push deeper into this pixelated robotic realm to recover their stolen goods is a high point in an adventure that feels like a bit of a slog despite its relatively short length.",0
"318","If you weren't crazy about Ninja Gaiden the last three times, this is the same game, so keep walking. Likewise if you already played either Black or Sigma, you're probably ok to hold off, too. But for those of you that only played the 2004 original, or missed the game entirely, you've now got a beefed up, extra content edition that you can play anywhere. That's worth flipping out and killing dudes over.",1
"319","Smart As is great at what it does. It's a fun brain teaser for you to pop in whenever you get a second or whenever you feel like a quick challenge.",1
"320","It's a more responsive, faster action title that does away with the damning side of its dazzling animation. This is a smooth brawler with gorgeous spectacle, and its dedication to nailing its second chance makes it one of the best action games in recent memory.",1
"321","There's plenty to like about Retro City Rampage from its nods to our childhoods to its easy to get behind gameplay to its arcade mini-games, but the story -- the main hook of the title -- just doesn't stand up.",0
"322","A fine game that Mega Man fans will enjoy once or twice, but one without that special something that would allow it to rise to the greatness Mega Man so regularly reached in its heyday.",0
"323","Unit 13 doesn't have flashy visuals or an in-depth campaign, but it does have good controls and plenty to do. I think the AI could use a tune-up and the visuals some polish, but if you're looking for a game to sink bullet after bullet into, Unit 13 will keep you entertained.",1
"324","Nano Assault Neo is their boldest, more beautiful shooter yet, and Wii U owners absolutely shouldn't miss out on its shiny twin-stick shooting.",1
"325","For an adventure absolutely beaming with personality and potential, the gameplay experience wasn't quite as fine as I would have liked, but it doesn't make Escape Plan anything less than a great game in its own right. It's just unfortunate, because it could have been more with slightly better execution.",1
"326","The lack of depth does wear thin over the long-haul after you've played a bunch of match to their conclusion, but you may find yourself reluctant to let go until you've fully experienced into each faction's magical might.",1
"327","The moves and kills you'd expect are here, but the story is boiled down to be easy to jump in and out of. That takes away some of the excitement in playing through it.",0
"328","It attempts to hit a note that would resonate with the hardcore gaming masses, but it falls short, and should only be purchased by those desperate for an experience like it on Vita.",0
"329","It's a shame that humdrum maps and a poor matchmaking setup occasionally sours the promising designs of each class' special abilities, but when it works, few free-to-play shooters grant such a memorable and thoroughly entertaining experience.",1
"330","The game never embraces its Mario heritage, never allowing itself to break out of a more typical tennis mold to be something unique.",0
"331","It's far from perfect and best viewed with ""launch goggles"" on, but Razor's Edge's unflinching action and unabashed violence is a great sign for the Wii U as a core gamer's platform.",1
"332","It's Piranha Bytes' most accessible game yet, and though its style and boorish, humorous dialogue fit well with the pirate motif, it's a role-playing experience that uses convention as a crutch and marginalizes or strips away a lot of elements that made the studio's past games stand out.",0
"333","At its core, it's FIFA 13 on Wii U is FIFA 12 from last year. You should probably wait for next season.",0
"334","It's more of a short-term investment than some might be expecting, then, but while you're caught in its irresistible loot cycle, you'll probably find it very hard to put down.",0
"335","Touch My Katamari is well-controlled and fun while it lasts, but it feels like the series has stagnated. The touchscreen controls are welcome, but I wish the developers had been a bit more creative with the Vita's functionality.",0
"336","Oftentimes the redo reflects the exact standards and formulas of its new genre rather than marching boldly into new territory. Syndicate falls into this trap, telling a boring tale of swapping allegiances amidst flurries of gunfire.",1
"337","If you're at all interested in the interactive fiction genre, knowing full well that there's not a whole lot of actual interaction, that's an eminently fair price.",0
"338","Shad'O may not offer much in the way of new gameplay mechanics over the countless other tower defense games already available, but it distinguishes itself through its striking art design and compelling narrative.",0
"339","Though it has some pacing issues and a seemingly useless upgrade system, the funny, meaningful stories had me reading right past them.",1
"340","The vague story and uninspired puzzles weren't special enough to keep my attention after that initial sense of awe waned, though, and when viewed alongside some annoying constraints that make the gameplay feel unnecessarily constrained, Little Inferno's few great ideas fall apart like so much ash.",0
"341","It's good, stupid fun no matter which side you play on, although a questionable option to switch sides midmatch occasionally leaves too many players stacked on the dino side.",1
"342","WayForward has struck gold once again, as the studio continues to prove its skill at crafting superb game designs for Nintendo platforms.",1
"343","It works as both a cathartically satisfying hack-and-slash on the easier difficulties, and a surprisingly thoughtful action-based strategy game on the higher levels.",1
"344","Beyond the winning localization and expert voice acting, though, playing through this adventure just felt lacking – its various unique ideas and innovations never came together to create a real sense of fun.",0
"345","Although it suffers from some inconsistent AI, spotty online matchmaking and some balancing problems created by Golden Abyss-centric augments, it's still hard to deny that Uncharted: Fight For Fortune is a fun game.",0
"346","Just Dance 4 is a generator of awkward moments, an engine powering missteps and bodily mayhem. Whether this is frustrating or fun will often come down to the blood alcohol level of the participants.",0
"347","There's an abundance of clever ideas at play in this undeniably creative 2D physics puzzle platformer -- the problem is they just don't translate to an experience you'll want to subject yourself to for very long once the steep difficulty really hits its stride.",0
"348","Ragnarok Odyssey doesn't deliver, and your money is better spent elsewhere.",0
"349","While it has some great mini-games, it forcefully limits itself and discards many of the ideas that made its predecessors so good.",0
"350","Because the gameplay is so straightforward, newbies to the genre who are nevertheless fans of the setting may find a friendly sort of Frankenstein monster to play with here.",0
"351","F1 2011 isn't quite up to the excellent standard of the console version, but it's still far, far better than the 3DS instalment.",0
"352","With more maps, classes, the ability to server browse and customization options promised there's a lot of potential in Forge, but what you're buying now feels like a beta with a great foundation.",0
"353","A great blend of tower defense and action with loads of personality and a cool hook.",1
"354","The only notable feature unique to the PC version of Choplifter HD is its spotty mouse controls. I preferred the precision of an Xbox game pad to my mouse, as the aiming is not only tuned better for it, but circular within the game as well. My mouse aiming was jittery and unreliable, which made hairy situations impossible.",1
"355","A functional shooter with a sense of humor and a Batman license. It's got plenty to unlock, but it's not all that deep. Go, shoot, win. Over and over. If you're looking for a first-person shooter that doesn't take itself seriously, have at it, but don't expect a FPS revolution.",0
"356","The combination of the excellent community, unwavering focus on running the business, and the simplicity of the controls and your responsibilities creates a unique business simulation that rewards you proportionally to the amount of work you put into it.",0
"357","None of its individual parts is particularly original, but put together in the way they have been, you end up with a synergistic success of a puzzle title that will test both reflexes and noggin-scratching abilities.",0
"358","Though 2 Dawn did an admirable job of blending accessible vehicle-based combat with a few instances of more sophisticated mechanics, it feels like the game could have used more development time to smooth out the technical issues and, ideally, add in more weapons and combat options.",0
"359","Flight is best sampled in its freebie guise.",0
"360","Tekken 3D Prime Edition definitely gets props for recreating the fast combat and fluidity of the series on a handheld. However, the lack of any real depth in the modes and lack of customization features for your fighters makes it tough to want to spend an extended amount of time with it.",1
"361","Shiny new Unreal Engine 3 graphics can't make up for simplistic, glitchy AI, a middling level selection, and busted, extremely underpopulated multiplayer. Go with Painkiller: Black Edition instead.",0
"362","Warriors Orochi 3 Hyper, while damaged in the shift from the other HD systems to the Wii U, ends up maintaining its appeal as one of this series' best installments.",0
"363","Despite its visual beauty and impressive execution, limited gameplay and general bugginess hold everything back. This beast has room to grow. When it does, expect great things. For now, a little turbulence makes for a bumpy ride.",0
"364","If you're a football obsessive or a stickler for the real thing, UEFA Euro 2012 is probably worth grafting onto your existing copy of FIFA 12. But for many, the same experience can easily be approximated by playing the game they already own with a through-ball from their imagination.",0
"365","Looks spectacular and does succeed in capturing the feeling of being a soaring bird, but falls short most everywhere else.",0
"366","Breathtaking to behold and controls beautifully, with well-designed levels and fun platforming. It's really too bad the experience is hampered by its unacceptably short length, as well as by the fact that the painting mechanic gets repetitive.",0
"367","If you haven't played FreakyForms before, this is probably the version to get, though the few improvements aren't enough to make the extra investment worthwhile for those who already own the downloadable version.",0
"368","The menus bury the coolest stuff, the touch controls are peculiarly particular, and even though the Vita is a connected device, I feel alone when I play this. If you're looking for a bright and colorful kart racer with good mechanics, ModNation Racers: Road Trip fits the bill, but it doesn't excel anywhere else.",0
"369","Levels quickly went from me being charming, engaging experiences to something I raced through as fast as I could. An hour into Pineapple Smash Crew I found I just wanted it to be over. And it's not even long.",0
"370","StarDrone Extreme may not assail your senses or do anything entirely new and exciting, but hell if it isn't fun for what it is.",1
"371","A passable option for those gamers looking for a little musical accompaniment to their parties. But a weak tracklist festers underneath Sing Party's accessible, bland exterior.",0
"372","The story here is forgettable, the action is formulaic, and the multiplayer is simplistic.",0
"373","Doom 3 is a very good game, probably better than you remember. For PS3 owners who've never gotten any of this content, it's a particularly great deal. BFG Edition is a tough sell for the PC crowd.",1
"374","Lucius can be engrossing, charming, and even darkly funny. Sadly, the game is bogged down by its poor execution, inconsistent atmosphere, buggy levels, and monotonous mission objectives.",0
"375","It mixes solid but underwhelming gameplay with a lackluster presentation. If you just want dungeons to crawl through and couldn't care less about polished menus and engaging stories, great.",0
"376","Sol: Exodus may be a step in the right direction to bring back space combat games, but it certainly won't be the title that inspires a generation to demand more. Any gamer, and especially PC gamer, over 25 probably wants the genre to flourish like it used to, but a game like Sol, with all its bugs, repetitive levels and lackluster narrative, won't be what brings it back.",0
"377","Speaking of wasted potential, if the developers wished to shove the Wii U GamePad down players' throats, they should have at least done something interesting with it.",0
"378","Like the other Michael Jackson games, Vita's first rhythm game suffers from a short setlist and only one real mode of play. It's a shame the experience ends in a tragic few hours, as dancing with your fingertips offers a special sort of enjoyment fitting for the King of Pop's best tracks.",0
"379","Its clever premise is really nothing more than a series of annoying bottlenecks for the gamer, and with so little in terms of in-game diversity, no reasons exist to actually see and do everything unless you're a dedicated completionist or Trophy hunter.",0
"380","Army Corps of Hell has a great premise, some intense boss fights, and a fantastic soundtrack. Unfortunately, the repetitious gameplay bogs the experience down, making this a trip to hell that you're not going to want to keep returning to.",0
"381","It's a decent piece of (admittedly overpriced) software. And its pretty, vivid graphics and surprisingly catchy old-school inspired soundtrack certainly please aesthetically. But a strong hook doesn't exist.",0
"382","The high definition resolution makes it the best-looking of all the versions, but the models and textures are all the same here – much more could be done on Wii U, and hopefully a future Transformers release will be able to actually take advantage of the new system's power.",1
"383","A generally good experience, and a fun one most of the time, but its issues keep it from truly ascending to the heights of being Spectacular. Or Sensational. Or Astonishing.",0
"384","Anna manages to create a few blood-chilling moments throughout its story, but most of the fear factor is neutered after you realize nothing can harm you.",0
"385","The issues themselves are a little more engaging than before, but the departure of quirky campaigns and beloved former presidents like Abraham Lincoln and JFK pose significant threats to its replayability. Without them, The Political Machine 2012 is a sober reminder of the problem that's plagued American politics almost since the beginning: at heart, it's still just the same old game.",0
"386","With a longer campaign and more content, Spirit Camera could have been a revolutionary experience. As is, it fails to go much farther than Face Raiders did - and that was free.",0
"387","The appeal of its randomly generated settings wears off quickly, the procedural level generation voids much sense of having an impact on the world, and the absence of any kind of compelling story or brilliantly designed levels eventually renders exploration a slog.",0
"388","Punishing players for staying the course through lengthy grind sessions seems counterintuitive when the idea is to generally keep people playing.",0
"389","Somewhere inside Miner Wars 2081 is an incredibly ambitious, frighteningly absorbing space game. As is, however, Keen Software's long-in-the-making opus feels like a half-complete realization of that vision.",0
"390","It has little ambition and middle-of-the-road execution. Nothing about this mini-game compilation stands out above any of the others we've seen on Wii – or Nintendo 64, for that matter.",0
"391","Funky Barn is very basic but passably entertaining. As a lower-price downloadable game it'd be much better value, but as a $50/£30 Wii U launch title it's more difficult to recommend.",0
"392","There's just not enough content or variety here to justify the expense of a full retail purchase.",0
"393","Dungeon Hunter: Alliance isn't as polished as Diablo and lacks the charm of Torchlight. Battling through its varied levels and sorting through mountains of loot is fun, when glitches don't get in the way.",0
"394","Asphalt Injection is a fun racing game, but it lacks depth, precision, and doesn't push the Playstation Vita to anything resembling its true potential.",0
"395","There's a bold premise lying underneath, but thanks to the marginalization of its promising building elements, it's little more than another mediocre shooter.",0
"396","Blowing up stuff is fun, but you'll end up fighting the controls and the game becomes a grind if you play it any real length of time.",0
"397","Playing Cortex Command breaks my heart. With online multiplayer, improved AI, more scenarios and a more fleshed out campaign it could be something truly great, but for now it's just a number of cool ideas and great looks grafted onto noticeably repetitious level design and sub-optimal local multiplayer.",0
"398","The PC version, as run on mid-range hardware, makes no such visual compromises, with gorgeous high-resolution textures, detailed faces, and smooth performance...A brilliant shooter that nudges the entire genre forward with innovations in both storytelling and gameplay.",1
"399","It fulfills the promise of a multiplayer Mario much better than anything that the Japanese game maker has done before. Super Mario 3D World is marvelous, and its constant variety and fantastic light-hearted co-op play proves that Nintendo still knows exactly how to tweak their Mario formula in fun ways.",1
"400","Fire Emblem Awakening is the most fluid and stunning strategy RPG experience available on a portable, and features the best storytelling and production value of any 3DS game to date.",1
"401","The sum of Fez’s intelligent level designs, perception mechanic, massive number of stages and secrets, and incredible art is so much more than just a shout-out to old-school gaming. Fez is a game in love with games.",1
"402","I haven’t been so challenged by a Zelda since Ocarina of Time, and rarely have I been so consistently surprised by one.",1
"403","Whether you’ve never heard of Flower or you replay it regularly, the PlayStation 4 version is an excellent, unforgettable return to one of PlayStation’s finest games. It’s still profound, and now it looks and feels better than ever. For those who appreciate experimental artistry, Flower’s zen exploration is as good as it gets.",1
"404","This is a superb 2D platformer that’s as easy to hate as it is to love, and your patience for punishment will be the determining factor. Players who live to overcome abusive challenges and obsess over discovering new things will hunger for Spelunky's deeply rewarding exploration.",1
"405","Holds up as a marvelous game full of unique and wonderful surprises that remind me why it’s the best of the 3D Zeldas.",1
"406","But once you start to learn its secrets, there’s a wild and exciting variety of play here that’s unmatched, even by its peers. It’s a challenge of knowledge as well as reflexes, and success is a rush.",1
"407","Whether you’re a fretboard virgin or a would be virtuoso, Rocksmith 2014 deserves a place in your daily practice routine.",1
"408","Deus Ex Human Revolution - Director’s Cut had an unenviable task: take one of 2011’s best games and make it even better, all while figuring out how to best utilize the oft-ignored GamePad. It succeeded on all fronts.",1
"409","What FIFA 14 on next-gen consoles does right now is add an impressive visual layer to an already brilliant sports game.",1
"410","Building on five generations of games, a digital menagerie of captivating creatures, and a wide range of diverse regions to explore, Pokemon X and Y proves this formulaic portable role-playing series can still deliver an innovative experience.",1
"411","All its different plotlines and personalities overlap and combine to create something that’s intriguingly opaque, but always entertaining, and genuinely funny. Whatever it is, it’s worth playing.",1
"412","It’s every bit as amazing on the PC as it is on its native PlayStation 3.",1
"413","New Leaf is a truly magical game, one that you can easily expect to invest hundreds of hours in over the course of years. Anyone with access to a 3DS should absolutely give this game a try - just be prepared to kiss your “real” life goodbye.",1
"414","Game Freak has really outdone itself this time, and Pokemon X and Y will be remembered as great transition point for the series’ transformation into an even more social, beautiful, and strategic game.",1
"415","Very few puzzle games have ever managed to marry impeccable challenges with a mature storytelling quite like this – there's no fluff or extraneous content here, only a prime example of how to create a tight, unforgettable gaming experience.",1
"416","It sincerely believes that imagination really is the most important faculty, and in turn, succeeded in transporting me back to a time when I built strange worlds equipped with nothing but crayons and card.",1
"417","FIFA 14 isn’t a leap into the future of the series; it has a lot in common with the version of FIFA 14 that's already out. There are real flashes of potential, though, and hints at where it may go in the future.",1
"418","Easy to recommend to anyone interested in historical strategy – it’s the best game in the series, which can now take its place, with no caveats, among the giants of the genre.",1
"419","A delight. There’s nothing else like its gentle combination of exploration, strategy and discovery, and it made me feel both empathy and responsibility for virtual creatures that most games would treat as disposable fodder.",1
"420","Velocity Ultra doesn't have screen-clearing super weapons or massive, three-stage boss fights like a lot of its vertically scrolling cousins do. But with its clever teleporting trick, it does something completely different from most of them and it does it extremely well.",1
"421","Gone Home is a remarkable achievement, and piecing together its poignant story will stick with me forever.",1
"422","This edition is not only a smooth-flowing piece of pro basketball simulation, it’s also one of the few games that makes a true next-generation leap in visual fidelity.",1
"423","Its appeal is shortened by the ludicrous speed at which we can zip across it and grow tired of its lack of challenge.",0
"424","While these new additions may have imbalanced Most Wanted U in some respects, they’ve also created a sandbox of greater possibilities and accessibility.",1
"425","Kerrigan's vengeful rampage may come with a generous helping of cheese and some tedious boss fights, but the chance to play with increasingly powerful units and abilities makes up for a lot – as does some inventive mission design and greater-than-average replayabilty appeal.",1
"426","An amazing expansion to a brilliant tactical game.",1
"427","Shows Nintendo at its inventive best. It’s an essential game in the 3DS’ increasingly impressive line-up, and though I sometimes wished that it would leave me alone to explore more at my own pace, it’s otherwise difficult to fault a game this detailed, absorbing and masterfully made.",1
"428","Path of Exile successfully captures the spirit of older action RPGs and updates it for an experience that's as visually appealing as it's fun.",1
"429","Its PS4 launch problems aren't easily forgiven, what with the unreliable stability DICE is striving to fix, but because the core game is so strong, Battlefield 4 is worth either sticking with or waiting for.",1
"430","This edition is not only a smooth-flowing piece of pro basketball simulation, it’s also one of the few games that makes a true next-generation leap in visual fidelity.",1
"431","Long-time Devil May Cry fans unsure of Ninja Theory's treatment can abandon their fears. DmC hurls Dante into a newer, better world, complete with a glorious combat system and enough style to make old Dante proud...This is digital action at its finest.",1
"432","Telltale has once again delivered a well-written adventure, this time with an added dose of stylish noir presentation.",1
"433","One of my favourite games of 2013 so far. It’s a hugely compelling mix of 2D action-platforming and Roguelike game design, with excellent pixel art and just the right level of challenge. It’s the wildly inventive traits system, however – and the fact that it’s meaningful – that really elevates Rogue Legacy.",1
"434","On face value there are fewer drastic improvements, but many gentle refinements to the UI and subtle additions to its newer formulas mean that Football Manager 2014 improves solidly where it counts.",1
"435","This is the most fun I’ve had with Civilization since Civ IV, and the best late-game since Civ II. Brave New World is the rare case of a title delivering exactly what it promises.",1
"436","Taking Terraria with you on-the-go puts an exciting spin on the absorbing formula, and the Vita version thankfully doesn't skimp on the goods. There's no depth sacrificed here.",1
"437","A fantastic idea, beautifully executed.",1
"438","There are more laughs in this DLC that many entire comedy games, made stronger by being undercut with a real poignancy.",1
"439","Etrian IV matches its hardcore depth to appealing visuals and more inviting design, and in doing so allows the series to transcend niche status. Atlus has crafted a fantastic portable RPG, and the perfect entry point for Etrian newcomers.",1
"440","A tense, challenging, and excellent shooter. It may be short, but its addictive cycle of cylindrical shooter gameplay, great looks, and catchy music make it worth replaying in endless pursuit of that high score on the leaderboard.",1
"441","If not for the confusing fake 3D effect, Mutant Mudds Deluxe would be the definitive version of Renegade Kid’s 2D platformer, with the same tight gameplay, charming graphics, and chirpy soundtrack bolstered by more levels than ever before.",1
"442","It’s more than 70 levels of superb tower defense that you can play wherever and whenever you want. Sure, I wish co-op carried over to single-player, that the difficulty spikes weren’t so maddening, and that there was a new island of levels, but that doesn’t take away from how excellent PixelJunk Monsters: Ultimate HD is.",1
"443","Gunpoint is a refreshingly welcome addition to the burgeoning stealth genre. It nails player movement, puzzles, and storytelling in games, and completely removes anything that stands in the way of these three.",1
"444","A great port of an amazing game. The extra world is a worthwhile addition, and the new easy mode should allow even more people to enjoy the ride.",1
"445","Shin Megami Tensei IV succeeds on the merits of its outstanding demon fusion system and combat, even if its story and exploration are only fair.",1
"446","Beyond the underwhelming main campaign, Black Flag delivers a world brimming with gorgeous places to go, amazing secrets to discover, and nefarious pirates to stab.",1
"447","Grounded in tradition and learning from the lessons of the games that preceded it, it thrives on the strength of its excitingly varied and flexible class system and highly mobile combat.",1
"448","With a great atmosphere and deceptively simple mechanics, it stands out as one of the most unique and addicting games of 2013.",1
"449","The fact that it’s built around something as simple as completing a map makes it accessible, but there are systems within – specifically when it comes to combat -- that make it dynamic and deep.",1
"450","Act II of Kentucky Route Zero provides another sharp walkabout into a beautifully surreal world. Though it poses more questions than it answers, it still left me pining for the next chapter. If the final three acts manage to be as powerful and evocative as the first two, Kentucky Route Zero is going to be looked back on as a tremendous and singular accomplishment in gaming.",1
"451","Splinter Cell is back on the right shadowy track.",1
"452","These tables have never looked better than they do on PS4, and the gameplay is authentic right down to the sound and pressure of each tables’ flippers.",1
"453","The monsters are stunning, the fights can be incomparably exhilarating, and the 3DS and Wii U connectivity is really impressive – even if the online infrastructure is still rather archaic.",1
"454","Antichamber has some of the more clever puzzles of any game I've played. It doesn't have much in the way of personality, and its bizarre ending left me wondering why it was included at all, but it makes the act of exploration utterly thrilling.",1
"455","The stellar game design is emboldened by the three different characters you can play as. From start to finish, Gunman Clive is a fantastic platformer, good enough that it is worth playing multiple times to play as every character.",1
"456","SteamWorld Dig is easily the best eShop game of the year.",1
"457","Last Light’s setting and presentation are its strong points, though the last third of its 10-hour campaign is weaker than everything that came before it.",1
"458","Well-designed maps, two dramatically different sides in the Americans and Japanese, and authentic feeling weapons make Red Orchestra 2: Rising Storm an excellent and unique-feeling first-person shooter.",1
"459","Battlefield 4 is an excellent multiplayer game that makes the most of its ambitions, proving once again that destruction is a valuable strategic addition to competitive combat, which reaches its full potential with two killer Commanders are bringing out the best in their squads. On the other hand, its single-player campaign is a disappointing.",1
"460","With strong visuals and convincing audio backing it up, I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent inside my P-36 Hawk, and its generous free-to-play model never got in the way.",0
"461","Dual Destinies won’t change anybody’s minds about the series’ brand of narrative-heavy, gameplay-light adventuring, but longtime fans will be thrilled by the full docket of goofy legal twists and turns and fun characters.",0
"462","As far as a first episode goes, Kentucky Route Zero establishes the setting, tone and characters better than I could have expected. I love that I'm still thinking about what exactly happened to Conway and company, and that intrigue has left me longing for the next piece of the tale.",1
"463","If you've never experienced this survival horror indie sidescroller before, this is the best way to jump in. The hero's journey seems particularly personal on the Vita in dark rooms, and the Vita's control scheme suits the retro experience implied by the visuals.",1
"464","It's an uneven experience, but occasionally it grasps greatness, making it a worthy addition to an already distinguished series.",1
"465","Blood Dragon is a different beast – and it’s something you shouldn’t miss.",1
"466","A well-curated car list, a great sense of speed, and a well-thought out career mode combine in a racer that is a lot of fun to play through.",1
"467","The Grimoire Stone system is too random to be consistently useful, and might make you miss out on a good chunk of Millennium Girl’s content. But what’s here is still some of the most difficult and rewarding turn-based battling you can find on the 3DS.",1
"468","Annoying design choices and forced moments of repetition have a bad habit of spoiling the mood, but between them is an experience that's scary as all hell.",1
"469","Story mode is a pleasant surprise, but the real reason to play is the thrill of harnessing the god-like powers of some of the most overwhelming figures in the comic realm.",1
"470","The Knife of Dunwall is satisfying to play, but fails to build much momentum in its story.",1
"471","Play the original first (it’s cheap) but Company of Heroes 2 satisfied my appetite for more.",1
"472","It’s best to think of Need for Speed: Rivals as a thrill ride. Get on, scream, plead to go faster, and it will.",1
"473","Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes becomes a stronger game by weakening its hero characters.",1
"474","Undercover’s story is an incredibly entertaining homage to countless movies and television shows, and manages to feature a very strong cast of characters – no small feat considering the game has no major license associated with it.",1
"475","Proteus is a very different sort of interactive experience. Maybe, by your definition, it's not even a game. But that doesn't matter. It's a joyous experiment in exploration from start to finish – even if it is a very, very short-lived one.",1
"476","It successfully borrows from table-top gaming and history itself to create a simulation that, more than most strategy titles, feels like war.",1
"477","Much like Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, this is a textbook example of a fighting game port done properly. Dead or Alive 5 Plus is the genuine article, matching and occasionally surpassing its excellent console brethren in nearly every regard.",1
"478","Smoothed-out, cleaned-up visuals are on by default, though you can do everything from toggling full widescreen to turning on artificial scan lines, simulating the interlacing of the coin-op cabinet’s CRT monitor.",1
"479","It may be lighter on girth than where we left off last generation, and still lacking much-requested features like night racing and rain, but wrestling a car through some of the world’s most legendary corners at the very limits of adhesion has never looked or felt this good on console.",1
"480","On 3DS, even without the Circle Pad Pro attachment, controlling the camera using the touchscreen works surprisingly well. It’s not quite perfect, but it’s certainly a lot better than it ever was on the PSP; it’s only noticeably slow when you’re fighting underwater.",1
"481","Played as intended with a group of friends, PayDay 2 is much like one of its heists: things can get a little sloppy, but the potential payoff is big.",1
"482","While I appreciate the world, atmosphere, and mechanics, I can't help but wish that there was a light at the end of Don't Starve's dark and lonely tunnel.",0
"483","Season 2’s premiere of The Walking Dead is predictable in good and bad ways — its character drama is strong, its technical prowess is not.",1
"484","It’s not only Vita’s prettiest game; it’s also a hell of a lot of fun to play. Immersive, stylish, and full of action, Muramasa Rebirth’s twin campaigns, multiple endings, hidden Demon Swords, massive exploration and other optional goodies are enough to keep you busy for a good long while.",1
"485","It may end in frustration, but its worth playing just to see how it masterfully hits all the survival horror notes with its distinct presentation and vicious design.",1
"486","The default game mode of Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move is little more than a Nintendo-themed reskin of the 25-year-old Pipe Mania, and frustrates with its randomness. The much better Puzzle Palace and Many Mini Mayhem modes, thankfully, leave us with a good game overall.",0
"487","Considering the elegance and sophistication of the world, combat and upgrade design, it’s a shame everything else seems so ho-hum.",1
"488","It’s amazingly inventive and full of color and bright-eyed character, but its control problems are so persistent they’re unignorable.",0
"489","Mercenary is a truly great shooter, one that was crafted with the hardcore shooter fan in mind. There’s a lot to love here -- even if its campaign is woefully short – from its deep Contracts mode to its engaging multiplayer functionality.",1
"490","Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition captures the essence of what makes fantasy RPGs so beloved.",1
"491","When comparing the PS4 and Xbox One versions side-by-side, there’s little to no variation in textures and effects, but there is a discernible difference in resolution. While both are displayed at 1080p, the Xbox One version upscales the game from 720p resolution. In contrast, the PS4 version runs natively at 1080p, which makes character models, weapons, and environments look noticeably sharper and more detailed. The difference is especially apparent on larger-sized TVs, where pixel density weighs more heavily in picture quality.",1
"492","Call of Duty: Ghosts isn't a reinvention of the franchise, but proves there's still room for innovation within its existing formula.",1
"493","Just be prepared to pack your patience and reign in your expectations of what wearing a crown means. You'll still be toiling in the fields like everybody else, but at least you can do so with a smile on your face.",1
"494","An excellent example of how games can do more with less. Its combat is deceptively simple, there are no character advantages, and the tight, dangerous environments each feel unique. However, the lack of an online multiplayer mode will likely keep it relegated to “great party game” status.",1
"495","Dead Rising 3 doesn’t get by on its looks, but its meaty zombie-slaying combat and nearly endless supply of undead and ridiculous weapons go a long way.",1
"496","Tough but gratifying, F1 2013 is not a startling improvement from the already robust F1 2012, but it’s certainly Codemasters’ best and most confident crack at F1 to date.",1
"497","The addition of its innovative competitive asymmetrical multiplayer is the big draw here – as long as everyone takes the time to learn the complex rules, that is.",1
"498","Eldritch's various components tend to work quite well on their own, and create most of a great Roguelike. But the speed and arbitrary nature of death means that the crazy desperate stories of near-death (or death) that make other games in the genre so memorable are unlikely to occur.",1
"499","Sanctum 2 improves on the first Sanctum in almost every way, including its robust leveling system and perks, its improved turret management, its visual style, and its customization.",1
"500","This HD version shares all the problems its predecessor has, including noticeably limited enemy variety and weak allied AI that can't hit the broad side of a barn.",1
"501","Soul Sacrifice straddles the line between delivering the depth typically found on console and the on-off-on-again routine of handheld gaming, and the result is something that will likely please Vita owners hungry for a quality, grind-heavy RPG.",1
"502","Peggle 2 is one-button joy. You think, you aim, you fire, and you sit back and watch as massive combos and bright popping colors take over. That it’s such a joyful sequel to an all-time classic stretches my grin from ear to ear, just like most of the rest of Peggle 2.",1
"503","It’s a relaxing and charming little adventure priced rather out of its comfort zone, but it is not without value.",0
"504","Its smaller levels, restrictive time limit, and floaty physics work well as a challenge mode add-on to an already terrific game. But as fun as it often is, this still feels more like an addendum to NSMBU – a remix, rather than something new that stands on its own.",0
"505","Toki Tori 2’s incredibly slow pace and lack of any true action make it an experience that is definitely not for everyone - but kids, puzzle lovers, and fans of all things adorable are in for a truly delightful and well-crafted experience.",1
"506","Naturally the PC version (our test machine was packing two AMD Radeon HD 7970 graphics cards) was the visually superior of the three, thanks to its higher definition, better lighting and textures and all manner of other fog effects and shading employed on the highest graphics settings.",1
"507","As with previous Total War games, the consequence of all those detailed and interrelated systems is a sometimes-obstructive interface and erratic AI. If you grow to love Rome II – and there is a lot to love about this game – you'll love it in spite of its persistent flaws and frustrations.",1
"508","For whatever else Dragon Commander is, it's also a game that puts big issues on the main stage, then lets us reap the rewards and shoulder the consequences of their decisions without moral judgment. For that reason alone, it's worth a look.",1
"509","If you’re on a budget and looking for a portable dungeon crawler with loads of content and personality to spare, it’s hard to get more bang for your buck.",1
"510","The bite-sized scope and limited choices available make me more interested to see what Shadowrun Returns will be a year from now, after the community has used the included mod tools to build on it, than in what it is today.",0
"511","I was looking for more explorations, depth, and variety, and in this department Rivals is slightly wanting, though it’s innovative approach to incorporating multiplayer does just enough to compensate.",1
"512","Its high level of difficulty, catchy tunes, and pixelated graphics meld nicely with its emphasis on loot, customization, and online play.",1
"513","There's elegance in ShootMania's simplicity, and it's great and refreshing to see some new ideas brought to a genre that's been largely abandoned by the big-name games. It does, however, lack personality and variety in weaponry.",1
"514","A few cute unlockable cards and tables are nice touches, but ultimately the lack of more modes, multiplayer, or anything else to substantially mix things up doesn’t give this game a lot of legs. Still, for the low ante it costs to pick it up, it’s worth it for the jokes.",1
"515","In terms of story, dialogue, and encounter design, this add-on pales in comparison to the rest of Borderlands 2.",0
"516","Reus is a gorgeous-looking, imaginative game which suffers from over-baked mechanics, but those hungry for to play god are still likely to find one of their favourite Populous-style games in a long while.",0
"517","It has some of the best car chases around, and they’ve never looked so chaotically beautiful as they do on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.",1
"518","MLB 13: The Show on Vita is the Oakland A’s of video game baseball: they play in a crummy stadium (the Vita), but when you look past that, they’re pretty damn good.",1
"519","Next to Arkham City, Arkham Origins is a bit of a disappointment in its lack of new ideas and use of win buttons, making it the least interesting of the trilogy",1
"520","It’s slow, and methodical, and there isn’t a grindable unlock or weapon crate to be found. It attempts to make you think about every step you take and every slight weapon tweak, but the odd hitboxes and frustrating lack of saved loadouts undermines some of the good work.",1
"521","On the current-gen versions I feel like I’m in complete control of everything, from passing to running, and that I can trust both the offensive and defensive line so I can focus on overall strategy. But this new version of Madden 25 meddles with the running game and it screws up the delicate balance between pass and run.",1
"522","At roughly three hours, it presents a fully realized, well-paced story arc with multiple peaks and valleys that does what many episodic games fail to do – wrap things up while leaving the door open for subsequent chapters.",1
"523","If you dig MegaTen (or classic RPGs in general), Soul Hackers is worth a look. Put on some Radiohead and sip an Orbitz to put yourself in a proper '90s mood and enjoy an oldie that still proves to be a goodie.",1
"524","PES 2014 looks better than ever and the gameplay's a lot of fun, but nostalgia stops it from being a huge leap forward.",1
"525","Arma III’s complexity is a double-edged sword. It takes a long time to comprehend, but once you’re comfortable enough with its mechanics to take advantage of them under pressure, you’re able to engage in a kind of large-scale tactical combat that’s simply not offered elsewhere.",0
"526","Neverwinter isn't a hardcore MMORPG, nor is it likely to compel you to cast aside your current favorite MMO to devote your full attention to it. But taken in small doses, it's a generally fun and free romp through one of fantasy's most beloved universes.",0
"527","This is an old-school shooter that actually gets what made old-school shooters work, and it gives us some clever new ideas on top of them.",1
"528","Its single-player campaign suffers from some AI issues and dabbling in non-shooter gameplay it’s just not good at, but it’s still an enjoyable romp that challenges you to really think about how you’re approaching each fight. And then there’s multiplayer, as hardcore as ever but with a level of accessibility that will allow Killzone’s online community to grow and flourish for some time to come.",1
"529","Escape Plan absolutely reeks of nonsense and humor, which is exactly what you'd expect from a team partially comprised of the squad that brought PlayStation Network gamers Fat Princess.",1
"530","From start to finish, the experience is so enjoyable that it's easily recommendable to any 3DS owner with an affinity for rhythm games. If only Game Freak would step out of their Pokémon shell more often, because the result of the developer's experimentation is awesome.",1
"531","Not only is its combat system flashy and well thought out, it's well explained too, thanks to its powerful training tools, and what is easily the most complete guide to terminology and tactics ever assembled in a fighting game.",1
"532","The next-gen versions add more detail pretty much everywhere, but in the end it makes me have to fight for control of my players and worry about little things that aren’t that interesting.",1
"533","Some of the options seem superfluous, and the gym functionality is totally ignorable, but it’s still a fun, effective way to get your sweat on.",1
"534","There’s not a lot here that wasn’t in Just Dance 4, or even Just Dance 3, but the series’ talent for getting people up and dancing is still unmatched.",1
"535","The matchmaking system is straight-up broken, leading to frequent frustrating mismatches, and its four maps aren’t enough to keep me around for long.",0
"536","Miraculously miniscule price tag or not, Van Helsing is a damn (and probably damned) solid game.",0
"537","With unintuitive controls, puzzle mechanics that’ve been done better elsewhere, and a story with the depth of a coloring book, it’s hard to stay invested in this short adventure.",0
"538","Though its sharp fangs of resource management may have been dulled, in place of the swift bite is a deeper, more haunting world that will linger with me much longer than the original.",1
"539","Cities in Motion 2's more realistic approach may leave it looking a little drabber than its predecessor, but its focus on dynamic cities, timetables, and ticket prices in a contemporary city in real time make it a significant improvement over its predecessor.",1
"540","For better or worse, Freedom Cry feels like an entire Assassin's Creed game distilled into five hours. That’s good, but it’s an Assassin’s Creed game that doesn’t include many of the steps forward that Black Flag so recently made.",0
"541","It’s a clever and challenging way to experience the classics without just retreading old ground.",1
"542","It's a darkly entertaining way to cut, explore, and appreciate the incredible skill of real surgeons.",1
"543","The smaller scale, lopsided balance, and multiplayer lobby screwups may keep it from being mentioned in the same breath as the biggest and best, but being a successful minor power in the pantheon of strategy games is still a fine achievement.",1
"544","Sid Meier’s Ace Patrol combines Firaxis’ storied tactics with fast-paced mission design and a user interface that translates well from touchscreen taps to mouse clicks.",1
"545","Even after completing Unmasked’s 12 levels, which took around 10 hours, I feel like I’ve only scratched the surface of the creative ways to unravel its enigmas - which makes me want to keep playing it even more.",1
"546","Ikachan is disturbingly short, but the winning game design and charm might make the $4.99 download worth your time, especially if you’re a fan of Cave Story or Nicalis’ other work.",0
"547","A breath of fresh air for both longtime fans of the show and brawlers in general. It’s as interesting outside of its missions as in them, with unique experience-point investing and gambling mechanics that future games in this genre should look to for inspiration.",1
"548","Digital Extremes has created something that's often genuinely fun to play, and given the cost of entry, Warframe's well worth a try if you're in the mood for something different.",0
"549","Its slant on side quests and completionism did, at first, scratch an itch for me, but Doki soon suffers from its sheer repetition, especially because it lacks any sort of tangible challenge. Doki-Doki Universe began to stumble from exceptional to acceptable as the hours wore on.",0
"550","With easy controls and lots of customization options, naval battles in Leviathan: Warships shine in multiplayer but sputter in the stagnant single-player campaign.",1
"551","Played with a mouse and keyboard Spartan Assault becomes a much more enjoyable experience, better able to recreate classic moments of Halo brilliance, but it’s still limited by hit-and-miss mission design and fiction that takes the urgency out of this fight for survival.",0
"552","Though Burial at Sea Episode 1 may be a short vignette next to Infinite’s novel, it’s still one you aren’t likely to put down for the brief time it lasts -- and it’s priced accordingly at $15.",0
"553","A solid game, but one that feels like a testbed for something much better - once the designers have the guts to fully chart a new path instead of relying on tried and Aperture Science-tested concepts we’ve all already seen played out.",0
"554","Project X Zone is often funny and consistently frantic – two traits not necessarily associated with tactical RPGs. Its story is confusing and the chapters slavishly follow the same repetitive formula, but the superb battle system makes repetition not just tolerable, but enjoyable.",1
"555","Retrovirus successfully updates the little-used concept of 3D six-axis combat known best from Descent for contemporary audiences, but it suffers from insane difficulty spikes, a tendency toward repetition and a disjointed story.",0
"556","In the burgeoning sub-genre of physics-based, liquid platformers, Puddle is a game that only hits a little more than it misses.",0
"557","Backing up that gleeful imagination with a mechanic that encourages good rather than simply energetic play makes for a rare treat that both novice and veteran brawlers can enjoy while it lasts.",1
"558","With its appealing graphics, stable servers, huge aircraft inventory, and no-cost entry fee, World of Warplanes is full of opportunities for dogfighting rookies and veterans alike to enjoy the thrill of the aerial kill.",1
"559","If you think you’d have enough concentration to be able to endure those quirks, though, Concentration Training could very well help you overcome the many distractions in your life.",1
"560","Thunder Wolves isn’t so much a wolf as a one-trick pony. And while that one trick – frantic, adrenaline-pumping action served with a healthy dose macho humor and feel-good firepower – is an exceptionally fun trick, it doesn't last long.",0
"561","Though at the risk of overcomplicating things at times, its robust multiplayer gameplay, surprisingly fun co-op modes, and lengthy, challenging, and varied campaign makes Ghosts one of the best Call of Duty games to date.",1
"562","I wish that Blackguards' character progression system wasn't such a mess, because if it worked, I'd be delighted to recommend the entire low-fantasy role-playing package without hesitation.",1
"563","While the animals are gorgeously detailed in their own right, learning about them and creating an enriching environment for the cuddly critters isn’t always presented in an enjoyable way.",0
"564","Features the same flaws and polish issues that marred the original, but also has the same addictive combat that leaves you yearning for more.",1
"565","While the inclusion of online play creates some issues with the slower-moving sports, it’s still a fun addition for Tennis and Baseball.",1
"566","One of the weirdest games to ever wear the Nintendo name.",1
"567","Once you get the hang of it all, the strategic combat and its required pre-game build strategy and in-game adaptivity is fun, but don’t expect to master its tricky team-based combat and overwhelming upgrade system without a serious commitment.",0
"568","The Last Ranger comes up short as a sequel, as it spends too much time retreading the same territory we saw in the first game and addresses none of its flaws.",0
"569","A fun but short addition to the franchise. It's an acceptable substitute to the console experience, mostly on the strength of its interesting villain and original story. Just don't expect to get as much content out of this one as you'd get on the consoles.",0
"570","Despite the intriguing fighting-game veneer, the mechanics underneath are very standard, and there’s not much else here to compensate for that fact.",0
"571","The Showdown Effect isn't all style and no substance, but it's definitely weighed disproportionately in favor of the former. On the upside, that means heaps of enticing potential, but it also leaves plenty of room for improvement. As is, Showdown Effect feels rough and unfinished.",0
"572","The Jak and Daxter Collection’s three games are excellent, but if you have the ability to play them on the PS3 (or hell, even the PS2), then that's the way to go.",0
"573","Don't call this XCOM. While its tactical combat works well enough to prevent The Bureau: XCOM Declassified from being straight-up bad, everything else is fumbled so often and so bizarrely that I can’t recommend it.",0
"574","As a game about family relationships The Novelist is interesting and relatable up to a point, but it doesn’t have a great deal of emotional depth, and the further you get into it the more you notice the flaws in its characterisation. Despite that, though, it’s worth a few hours of your time.",0
"575","At moments it can be wildly entertaining, but those moments come bundled with a terrible camera, uneven level design, and combat that tends to cheat you as often as it challenges you.",0
"576","Noticeably repetitious levels and bad storytelling can't overshadow the awesome feeling of piloting the Strike Suit, and simulation fans and less-hardcore players alike will find plenty to like in Strike Suit Zero.",1
"577","If you like a challenge and don't mind a grind, you may be able to find out if Fang's stuck-up attitude and selfishness carry him all the way through to getting his revenge.",1
"578","Slender: The Arrival manages to deliver some truly impressive scares, but you’ll have to wade through the muck of repetitive tasks and unfair enemies in order to experience them. I found more enjoyment in playing the free original installment, which delivers a powerful horror experience without the annoyances and filler.",0
"579","A Murder of Ravens saves The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief from going down in flames, but its narrative repetition and technical defects make for a turbulent ride.",0
"580","Although Sorcery Saga’s roguelike elements and minor glitches made me feel incredibly frustrated at times, I still enjoyed the story and characters enough to power through its multileveled dungeons just to see what happened once the credits rolled.",1
"581","A surprisingly deep experience with a variety of ways to play. While there are some duds to be found in each mode, there are enough highlights to have fun in plenty of different ways.",1
"582","The lack of notable features of previous games, especially four-player matches, is puzzling and disappointing. Instead of the definitive Dr. Mario experience, Dr. Luigi is an interesting spin of an established classic.",1
"583","Powerstar Golf manages to successfully marry an old-school arcade golf experience with some decidedly new-school ideas. The lack of proper online multiplayer is a bit of a blow, but the Rivals mode has the potential to provide an ongoing challenge after you’ve scooped up all of the career medals.",0
"584","It’s a serviceable arcade game that provides its own share of fun, but it’s also repetitive – occasionally gratingly so – with a façade of robust customization options hiding the fact that we’re doing the same thing over and over again underneath.",0
"585","It’s just not very good. Rare well-designed quests are overshadowed by a host of others that feel phoned in, and though the fundamentals of shooting are competent, weak enemy AI makes the PvE combat a bore.",0
"586","In some ways I'd equate SimCity to an early version of Minecraft: a wonderfully creative toy attached to a barely functional game.",0
"587","The core gameplay, including the variety of suits and weapons, is terrific, and it’s reason enough to play this sci-fi shooter. But the boring story, too-similar missions, and aggressive payment model hold it back from what it could be.",1
"588","With dragon taming, action combat, and robust skill and housing systems, there's an enjoyable experience at the core of Dragon's Prophet that never manages to break free of the dull environment and grinding pace that surrounds it.",0
"589","Sonic Lost World clumsily tears all the wrong pages out of the Super Mario Galaxy playbook, and in so doing, loses the breathless speed and fluidity that makes a Sonic game a Sonic game.",0
"590","A complete disappointment. After such an exciting start, King Art allows the series to slide into mediocrity by subjecting us to illogical gimmickry and by replacing its hero with someone I couldn’t really care about.",0
"591","Developer High Moon gets the character and brings the funny, but none of the action finesse that would make Deadpool stand out.",0
"592","At its best, it presents a gleefully cutthroat philosophy of human interaction, pushing you to be as terrible as possible within a charming cartoonish parody. It doesn't always manage to hold onto that feeling, but Redshirt has enough unique personality to endure.",0
"593","Just be prepared for a lot of fog, a lot of loading, no voice acting and a jarring framerate.",0
"594","It's an eclectic mixture of imagination, interpretation, and (purposefully constrained) interaction that really doesn't work as often as it should, but – on the rare occasions when all the pieces fit together – it creates some heart-fluttering highs.",0
"595","Contrast is a game full of heart, beauty, and at least a few excellent puzzles.",1
"596","Betrayer’s unique setting, style, and grim stories that pepper the journey all make this a game that’s eye-catching at first glance and briefly emotional. But the things you actually do in this world rarely come across as anything other than uninspired.",0
"597","It's a bland and perfunctory experience, one that won't offend anyone but is incapable of delighting anyone either.",0
"598","There are flashes of greatness in Lost Planet 3...But flashes are all they are, and the often frustrating metaphorical dimness between them makes up the bulk of its 15-hour single-player campaign gets in the way of admiring them.",0
"599","Plagued by a ho-hum delivery and combat occasionally interrupted by redeeming boss fights, it fails to distinguish itself.",0
"600","Some parts of the future are stuck in the past, but it’s strikingly well-balanced, providing solutions for existing problems and new toys to tinker with that counteract each other nicely.",1
"601","Batman: Arkham Origins - Blackgate is a good extension of the Arkham franchise to handhelds, but it lacks the specialness or inspiration that would make it stand out as a great Metroidvania-style game - or a great Batman game, for that matter. Without any real surprises, engaging settings, or interesting story, Blackgate feels more like a retread of bullet points than the handheld Batman we truly deserve.",0
"602","Rather than fix the graphics and the performance problems that plagued the original two years ago, Techland slightly modified the setting and delivered a new character and more content. It’s a fun time, but there are no surprises or killer new features to make it an impressive package.",0
"603","What worked in 2009's original first-person brawler works here as well, but inadequate maps, strange combat balancing, and several other quirks make it hard to call the sequel a substantial improvement beyond its new areas and creatures.",0
"604","Wario Ware was once bristling with creativity and energy, fizzing and sputtering with mad, short-form ideas, but Game & Wario is just a bit boring. The selection of games is sparse, and a couple of excellent ones don't make up for the rest.",0
"605","Ryse has an entertaining story and sky-high production values. The gameplay that’s there isn’t bad – it just stops in its tracks before it gets anywhere near close to demanding.",0
"606","It's an adequate twin-stick shooter, and a few years ago that might have been enough. With so many zombie games out there now though, one this uncommitted to its own ideas can never hope to be more than just part of the horde.",0
"607","It’s at its best when it marries its poignant story to its platforming, and at its weakest when it’s about moving boxes, but it rarely goes very long without showing us something worth playing.",1
"608","While only the combat stands out as a true high-point, Mars: War Logs is at least an ambitious attempt at a budget RPG, in a much less overused setting than most.",0
"609","Sonic’s sensation of speed is mostly intact and most stages look impressive, but Sonic: Lost World stumbles due to poor level design.",0
"610","Its creepy ambiance and wide range of puzzles manage to carry the weaker segments, but an out-of-place final boss with timed platforming ruins the fun.",0
"611","It’s initially interesting, but the asking price is very high for such a basic and short-lived game.",0
"612","If you keep in mind that this is a budget release when setting expectations of how many maps, guns, and customization options it should contain, there’s plenty of fast-paced action to be had gunning all the way through Hades – one weeping classicist at a time.",0
"613","Some of the most disappointing games to play are those that have brilliant ideas, and even pull a few of them off, but can’t maintain quality across the board. Horizon is an extreme example of that category, where a quarter of it is some of the cleverest design turn-based space strategy has seen in years, half of it is fine, and the last quarter is virtually unplayable.",0
"614","The main problem with Space Hulk, though, is that its designers couldn't let it deviate from or build on the simple rules of a board game experience that lacks tactical depth.",0
"615","There’s little of the engaging combat and compelling visual progression systems found in classic isometrics like Diablo and Baldur’s Gate, nor is there the scope and wealth of content that characterises major MMO games. Given the talent and license behind it, that’s a real shame.",0
"616","Island Tour’s single-player campaign is laughably bad, and the ambitious, content-rich multiplayer options and unique game boards are ultimately dragged down by mostly boring minigames and unfortunate system-jerking motion control.",0
"617","A big, ambitious blunder of a game that very occasionally sings with inspired ideas. Its transition to the Vita brings little other than touch screen control and a more attractive game-world.",0
"618","Great horror stories are many things, but tedious isn’t on the list, and that’s exactly the feeling that’s born of Knock-Knock’s inability to explain itself.",0
"619","A streamlined, easy to understand MOBA for those looking for an entry point to the genre.",1
"620","There’s some nostalgic value, too, but its weak graphics and frustrating free-flight boss fights make it tough to enjoy the stroll down memory lane.",0
"621","Playing Knack is like watching a dull movie on a plane – it's tolerable if all you want is a way to pass the time, but it's not something you'd seek out for its own sake. I finished in about 11 hours and, challenges, co-op, and secrets aside, there's just not much here worth recommending.",0
"622","It suffers from an almost total absence of risk or failure even on the hardest difficulty. There's charm and a good soundtrack in store here, but it quickly loses its appeal amid gameplay that never stops feeling as though you're working your way through a tutorial.",0
"623","With all the crashing and lame microtransactions, it’s kind of ridiculous that this is the first Halo game to appear on Microsoft’s next-generation console.",0
"624","Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 isn’t bereft of good ideas or mechanics, it’s just that they’re all trapped in a short series of levels that rarely give you anything all that interesting to do with them.",0
"625","Its inconsistent gameplay becomes tedious despite its imaginative variety, and its levels lack cohesion or a sense of momentum. Like the cheesy 90's films it apes, LocoCycle is memorable, but not quite good.",0
"626","Valhalla Knights 3 is a disappointment. It has fun moments, but actually enjoying it means wading through a bog of repetition that left me feeling tired and dirty when I reached the other side.",0
"627","Ultimately, I found myself getting more and more frustrated with each death until it got to the point where completing a level felt like more of a relief than an accomplishment.",0
"628","The controls are sometimes clunky and unresponsive when walking around, and the screen even froze once right in the middle of a transaction. Add in a poorly designed village that’s too spread out and a temperamental camera that keeps changing angles, and Hometown Story’s mechanics go from forgivably faulty to downright aggravating.",0
"629","Aliens: Colonial Marines looks like Aliens, and sounds like Aliens, but unfortunately it just doesn’t feel like Aliens. Instead, it feels indistinguishable from almost every shooter you’ve played in the past twenty years.",0
"630","I’m glad to have had a reason to revisit it, and am happy to find it even more impressive than it was before.",1
"631","Its world is a truly astonishing achievement in so many ways, and these two versions are currently the best way to experience it, aside from the hobbled multiplayer matchmaking.",1
"632","It’s as much a masterpiece on PS4 as it is on PS3, and it’s worth your undivided attention whether you’ve played it already or are about to jump in for the first time.",1
"633","Nearly every aspect of Smash Wii U seems fine-tuned not only to appeal to the nostalgia of long-time Nintendo fans, but also to be accessible to new players. Once they’re hooked, it draws them in deeper with a set of great modes and tempting rewards.",1
"634","This sequel builds on everything that made the original great, and delivers one of the most satisfying action games I've played.",1
"635","The real star is still the ability to play on the couch with up to three friends, tearing through the angry hordes that await you in adventure mode, where the wildly randomized dungeons form the backbone of Diablo 3's endgame.",1
"636","It ain’t pretty, it ain’t noisy, it will absolutely piss you off, but that only makes those successes all the sweeter.",1
"637","It’s a surprisingly huge, dense world, and I soon realized there were still entire sandboxes I hadn’t even set foot in. Even in my hundredth hour, I’m still discovering.",1
"638","That sense of creative progression, coupled with the inherent danger of exploring underground caverns full of monsters, makes Minecraft exciting, rewarding, tense, and one of gaming’s most expressive creative outlets.",1
"639","The best kart racing game Nintendo has made in a long time. It strikes a careful balance between refining old ideas while introducing fresh new ones. Admittedly, its gorgeous graphics and jazzy orchestrated soundtrack bolster its presentation, but you’re getting a lot more than just looks with this one.",1
"640","Reshaping a pristine landscape into new world using your own two hands while things try to kill you isn’t just an amazingly rewarding gaming experience, it’s a clever retelling of human history.",1
"641","Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition isn't a vapid rebranding or a blatant cash-in, but a welcome infusion of the original game with new areas, monsters, and bundled-in DLC.",1
"642","The elegant simplicity of Hearthstone’s rules, its impressive attention to detail and personality, and the true viability of playing completely for free make it easy to fall under its spell and get blissfully lost in the depths of its strategic possibilities.",1
"643","Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition isn't a vapid rebranding or a blatant cash-in, but a welcome infusion of the original game with new areas, monsters, and bundled-in DLC.",1
"644","After a day with Shadow of Mordor on Xbox One, I can confidently recommend it just as strongly as the PS4 and PC versions. True, this is probably the worst-looking of the bunch by a small margin.",1
"645","A fun and approachable battle royale that makes excellent use of its deceptively simple retro looks and classic arcade platforming style.",1
"646","Every second is a mad scramble for ammo, powerups, and survival that, while sadly limited to local play only, kept my group of four players glued to their controllers with its highly competitive action.",1
"647","With Reaper of Souls, and the recent round of content patches, Blizzard has transformed Diablo 3 into something far more akin to what long-time fans like me wanted all along.",1
"648","Divinity: Original Sin is one of the most rewarding RPGs to come along in years.",1
"649","An emphasis on fun pervades every detail of the experience, whether it's in the prevalent rare enemies dotting the countryside, the chance of upgradable loot, or bonus areas that encourage exploration.",1
"650","Not only is it an outstanding Vita and PS4 game, but it’s the first game in a long time to give me the thrilling sense of mastery that a well-played level of Sonic the Hedgehog used to back in the 90s.",1
"651","Though Titanfall is somewhat regrettably a barebones game in terms of modes and customization features available at launch, its intense action is almost as exciting to watch a friend play as it is to pick up the controller yourself.",1
"652","The time I’ve spent with Binding of Isaac: Rebirth has been non-stop fun and surprises, with just a tad too much frustration when I lose a rare item.",1
"653","It’s surprisingly lacking many accoutrements we’ve come to expect in a multiplayer shooter, but it nevertheless unites its elements in a cohesive, approachable way. Titanfall earns a seat at the table with the genre’s entrenched powerhouses.",1
"654","Now, with the Ultimate Evil Edition on PS4 and Xbox One, Diablo 3 takes on its highest form, melding the successes of two years of patching with the positive side-effects of porting to current-gen consoles.",1
"655","The upstep in visual detail from the older console versions is a nice bonus, but Tomb Raider didn’t need massaging. It’s the same well-realised action reboot for Lara Croft that came as such a pleasant surprise last year.",1
"656","The location is right, the car list extensive, the handling nuanced but accessible, and the visuals are excellent. Above everything it’s always fun.",1
"657","Resogun's core remains intact and as fun as ever. Heroes simply acts as a reason to come back for more.",1
"658","Much like Portal, The Talos Principle makes you feel smart just by playing it, as the bulk of the puzzles hit that sweet spot between too easy and near-impossible.",1
"659","The Legend of Grimrock 2 is an RPG that's as much Myst as D&D, and benefits from the strengths of both.",1
"660","Not only one of the most expansive RPGs I’ve ever played, but one of the few that successfully fills its gorgeous, massive world with meaningful things to do and see. A frustratingly vague plot and typical BioWare bugginess drag it down a bit, but both in combat and out, Inquisition marks a welcome return to the RPG depth that made Dragon Age: Origins and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic so magnetic.",1
"661","Fans and open-minded newcomers will enjoy a substantial adventure that proves the JRPG is alive and kicking.",1
"662","It is, in a way, Season 18 all by itself. It is funny, shocking, self-effacing, and pretty much everything I could ask for from a South Park game -- even if it’s mostly a one-and-done experience.",1
"663","Despite its less than compelling plot, I still want to go back to explore and fight through every nook and cranny of Dragon Age: Inquisition, until every dragon’s skull is mounted on my wall.",1
"664","Smash 3DS is impressive and, for the most part, feels right at home on 3DS. The multitude of ways to play and awesome customization gave me many reasons to keep fighting - and I’ve been at it for more than 45 hours already.",1
"665","Shovel Knight is my favorite game of 2014 so far, and a true testament to the power of the old-school. Whether you were weaned on an NES like I was, or don't yet know what you missed in a time before you were born, Shovel Knight is an absolute must-play.",1
"666","Valkyria Chronicles is gorgeous, engrossing, and not for the impatient. In other words, it's a great fit for PC gamers, who'll hopefully give the underappreciated Valkyria a wider audience than it found on PS3.",1
"667","This collection delivers more than a huge Halo fan like myself could have reasonably imagined and, even with its (hopefully temporary) online issues, it packs an insane amount of first-person shooter greatness onto one disc.",1
"668","A blast to play in short bursts... The lackluster presentation, however, hinders the overall experience, making it difficult to play more than a few games per sitting.",1
"669","Adventure mode’s poor pacing and repetition didn’t hold my interest, but King and Pacifism modes are much more interesting – as are the helpful A.I. drones, which provide more than enough reasons to go back and chase those leaderboards.",1
"670","Diversity is one of Far Cry 4’s strongest assets, and it overwhelms the mostly disappointing story with countless opportunities for free-form adventure and fun.",1
"671","It’s still well-written, sympathetic, exciting, beautiful, and just incredibly well-made.",1
"672","Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor stands out from other open-world action games by putting a great new layer on top of the trail that Batman blazed. I was surprised at how well it integrates its excellent combat with rewarding feedback and progression not just for me, but also for my enemies.",1
"673","Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor stands out from other open-world action games by putting a great new layer on top of the trail that Batman blazed. I was surprised at how well it integrates its excellent combat with rewarding feedback and progression not just for me, but also for my enemies. I",1
"674","Guilty Gear Xrd has enough wacky characters and well-crafted tutorials to be interesting for novices, but it’s those of us seeking a challenge that will find the most to love here.",1
"675","The updated art style proved overwhelming at times, but the winning soundtrack and forgiving save system were always there to encourage me to play through the frustration. In the end, I simply couldn’t put it down.",1
"676","Any of Tales from the Borderlands Episode 1: Zer0 Sum’s minor setbacks feel like nothing when put up against the strength of the characters, the caliber of the writing, and the charm of the world.",1
"677","Despite their seemingly miserable setting, both Metro games are in fact fun, diverse shooter-adventures, and the remastered 2033 does a good job of smoothing down the original's rougher edges at the expense of some of its brutal personality.",1
"678","Prime’s simultaneous turn structure makes for a tense experience that’s both intelligent and rewarding.",1
"679","Getting both [titles] in a single, enhanced package is a great way to discover (or rediscover) the Moscow Metro's unconventional charms.",1
"680","A beautiful remake that irons out nearly all of the problems and limitations of 1997’s Abe's Oddysee while bringing its best qualities to the fore.",1
"681","The Wolf Among Us Episode 5: Cry Wolf is a wonderful cap to Telltale’s season. It made me not only want to replay the episode to see various outcomes, but the entire series to see if I had missed any clues planted early on.",1
"682","Each map is polished, every God looks and sounds great, and exceptional Match of the Day modes offer plenty of variety. Some late-game balance issues aside, Smite’s divine execution of innovative ideas make it a worthy contender.",1
"683","Though there were points when its puzzles completely stumped me, and the combat’s steep difficulty, made me want to launch my 3DS into orbit a few times, the enjoyable battle system, deep exploration, and generous dollops of fanservice made it worth the effort.",1
"684","The PlayStation 4 and PC versions are nearly identical save for one feature: On PS4, you can choose to have the sword’s voice come out of the speaker on the controller. While it seems gimmicky on paper, I found myself playing through the entire game this way, and really appreciating the immersion it added to my experience.",1
"685","One of the year's most thoughtful games.",1
"686","Getting both [games] in a single, enhanced package is a great way to discover (or rediscover) the Moscow Metro's unconventional charms.",1
"687","Whether or not you have ever enjoyed Metal Gear, this is a must for anyone who appreciates melee-combat. It’s simple, fast, and clean, with enough supporting content like additional weapons and secrets to encourage a campaign replay – or more, if you find yourself obsessed with the idea of a no-kill run.",1
"688","Transistor is a wildly smart action-RPG that places all of its trust into your intelligence. Nothing from its cyberpunk story rife with mysteries, to its deep combat that encourages experimentation, is ever spelled out for you, which I personally loved.",1
"689","This is a Call of Duty game to its core, but one that rehashes as little as possible while still retaining its strengths.",1
"690","Feels like a new-gen experience that 2K isn’t quite ready for. It’s an absolutely beautiful game to look at, and its controls are as tight as they’ve ever been. Some features are vastly improved from last year, and fortunately most of those continue to work when the servers don’t. It’s a shame that the best game modes won’t always be accessible, because this could’ve been an amazing basketball game.",1
"691","Don't expect great depth or long-term thrills, but the action while it lasts is a master of both second-by-second action, and the structures that effortlessly stretch it out into a good few hours without it overstaying its welcome.",1
"692","Beneath Broforce’s hyperbolic chest-thumping action movie-inspired silliness lies an extremely polished run ’n gun platformer. Simple and reliable but nuanced and ever-changing (thanks to the constantly rotating characters) Broforce is testosterrific.",1
"693","Being able to play something that celebrates over two decades of excellent music brought me lots of joy, and serves as a reminder that Final Fantasy has some of the best music in video game history.",1
"694","Tropical Freeze is a great platformer full of tense sequences and tough levels. Boss battles are a huge highlight, and it’s packed with hard-to-find secrets and collectibles.",1
"695","Little details, like characters turning their heads to look as you pass or flocks of Wingulls flying overhead, make the region really come to life, and small updates and tweaks help make the journey smoother. Still, a few of its flaws are even more glaring in 3D, especially the excess water Pokémon and often dull navigation of their habitats.",1
"696","The artwork on display is stunning, and the combat is constantly engaging, and the characters openly defy genre convention. But perhaps the best thing I can say about Child of Light is that I was often unsure as to whether I was headed in the direction I was supposed to, and I never once cared. I just wanted to fly to every corner of the world, take it in, and smile.",1
"697","New 3D maps add depth and ideas to a tried-and-true formula, but they aren’t taken far enough to make this feel like a real sequel.",1
"698","Thanks to its clever puzzle design and brilliant progression, Stealth Inc. 2: A Game of Clones sets itself apart from its more obvious inspirations.",1
"699","It embraces its PS2-era roots while offering almost everything you could want from a modern football simulation.",1
"700","In some ways it’s a step forward, in others a step back - and with Konami’s PES seemingly in resurgent form, EA Sports can’t afford to take its eye off the ball.",1
"701","Though it’s an unmistakable tribute to Metroid and Castlevania, infusing a sharp wit and bold style helps Shantae and the Pirate’s Curse stand above its retro-inspired contemporaries.",1
"702","Sportsfriends is one of the most dynamic and addictingly deep local multiplayer games I’ve ever played.",1
"703","Plays out on one of the greatest, most beautiful maps in strategy gaming history. It combines style, substance, and setting into a marvelous overall experience for both empire management and tactical combat. It struggles slightly with strategic depth, but this is a science fiction and fantasy strategy game with tremendous soul.",1
"704","A Crooked Mile represents a new high point in Telltale's take on Fables. It's a smart, brutal, and emotional episode that pushes the story forward and fleshes out nearly every player on the board.",1
"705","Like a great player toughing it out through an injury, NBA 2K15 is still strong despite crippling server problems.",1
"706","None of it feels focus-tested, or designed to appeal to the broadest possible audience; rather, it always comes off as exactly the expression its creators intended.",1
"707","It's not a cheery story, but it's one well told and worth at least the three or so hours it takes to appreciate without the sometimes unintuitive puzzles, or as long as they take to solve.",1
"708","An amazing achievement. Its story is powerful, its freedom is liberating, and its world is one of the most beautiful I’ve ever wandered around. Here’s to more games not holding your hand.",1
"709","It’s a little safe, overall -- its competitive multiplayer stands out as a gamble that paid off -- in that it has many familiar elements from Far Cry 3 transplanted to an amazing new place, but those elements are incredibly empowering and rewarding.",1
"710","Dark Souls 2: Crown of the Sunken King is a brutal, but entertaining opening to a coming trilogy of DLC.",1
"711","I’ve always felt PES was at its best as a couch-based multiplayer game, but it’s heartening to see such a robust online component.",1
"712","FIFA 15 remains one of the most impressively comprehensive sport simulations around, and on new-gen hardware it really is the beautiful game. But while some of FIFA 15’s refinements are worthwhile – and a tangible improvement on FIFA 14 – its flaws stand out all the more.",1
"713","Its fast and easy flow of action and puzzling is easy to recommend.",1
"714","While launch bugs and a few lackluster mechanics mildly restrain WildStar, they’re isolated pockets in a colorful sea of creativity and personality. WildStar is loud, bright, and raucous, and if that style doesn’t click with you than WildStar probably won’t either, but it’s also a deep and open experience that will undoubtedly return as much as you care to put into it.",1
"715","An absolute joy of an adventure. It’s filled with unforgettable characters, incredible puzzles, and one of the most gorgeous worlds you’ll find in games. It culminates with an effective cliffhanger that has me counting the days until I can finish Vella and Shay’s adventure in Act 2.",1
"716","While the omission of leaderboards and StreetPass functionality does make Siesta Fiesta a lonely experience, it’s still a fun, challenging game that deftly blends a variety of retro genres.",1
"717","It’s the most exhilarating competitive game I’ve played in years.",1
"718","Save for a few puzzles that lose luster due to unintuitive and touchy physics, I mostly enjoyed testing both my platforming timing and my problem-solving skills with Kalimba's brain-busters.",0
"719","The increased emphasis on defensive play, a great new play-calling system, and the return of long-time favorites makes this year’s Madden one of the best in recent memory, even if it could still use work in regards to its stale commentary and longstanding bugs.",1
"720","Sunless Sea gives you a wonderful world to explore and packs it with memorable written vignettes. Its permadeath flirts with repetitiveness, and combat is disappointing, but it’s far from running out of ways to inspire one more trip back across the Unterzee.",1
"721","In Harm’s Way deepened my empathy for characters I’m legitimately worried will die, or worse.",1
"722","With an essential early-game choice that makes it worth playing through twice, the story at the center of Wolfenstein: The New Order props up its competent -- but mostly unremarkable -- shooting.",1
"723","The way Sledgehammer has integrated its enhanced abilities and choices into every aspect of how we fight went above and beyond.",1
"724","It may seem strange to complain that a game’s too long, but when the genuine scares of being hunted by an unstoppable predator are so diluted by repetition and padding, Isolation’s epic length really does work against it.",0
"725","Treasure Tracker takes the core concept of Captain Toad and runs wild with it. It’s a smart, adorable puzzle game that presents some awesome locales and really rewards you for taking the time to unpack them. Despite the control issues and menu problems, Captain Toad Treasure Tracker proves that you can still be great without being Super.",1
"726","It doesn't take many risks with the established formula, but its story is engaging, intelligently written and compelling to the end.",1
"727","A clever campaign with hard, meaningful decisions to make at every turn is hindered only by how zealously it insists you live with the consequences of those decisions – even if it means throwing away hours of hard-fought victories because a couple engagements went poorly.",1
"728","Episode 2 is one of the best Telltale has ever made. It’s big, full of great dialogue, devastating consequences, memorable and fun action scenes, and places a smart, scary plot at center stage.",1
"729","Big, gorgeous, and a hell of a lot of fun. Never has getting from point A to point B in an open-world game provided so much enjoyment. It provides some of the most fun, frantic, and fantastic gaming I've had on the Xbox One.",1
"730","Defense Grid 2’s new variations on the original’s excellent tower defense gameplay pulled me right back into the compulsively addictive quest to destroy all aliens with a minimum of expenditure.",1
"731","Beyond Earth is nowhere near the strongest game in the more than 20-year-old Civilization series, but this big collection of interesting experimental ideas definitely still kept me playing long after I should’ve gone to bed.",1
"732","Wasteland 2 might not be the prettiest CRPG to hit digital shelves this year, but it captures the harsh hypothetical realities of the post-apocalyptic American Southwest with excellent writing, decisions with terrifying consequences, and background voice work that reinforce the human suffering that results from them.",1
"733","Galactic Civilizations 3 doesn't do much to change the established explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate grand strategy model aside from its ideological advancement tree, but its extensive customization, faction personality, and overall quality make it an excellent game.",1
"734","Car chases aside, Watch Dogs is fundamentally very well made, and has more than enough unique ideas to make it a great and memorable open-world action game.",1
"735","Aside from its problematic ending, Ground Zeroes mostly represents a new, more sophisticated era for Metal Gear, particularly given its attention to what matters on PC.",1
"736","Trials Fusion is at once mercilessly exacting, and regularly thrilling. It allows you to exert an impressive level of control over your rider, and leverages that control to create nuanced, challenging tracks that beg to be run, and re-run until perfection is attained.",1
"737","It was refreshing to experience something truly different, even in the well-worn territory of the old-school. I was especially impressed by its dedication to its strange and novel mechanic, one that makes it so much more than yet another retro-inspired side-scroller.",1
"738","The Banner Saga deserves commendation for the strength of its art and music experience alone, which shatters conventions. That experience, in turn, complements a bleak story of a world teetering before its fall, where the harshness of the Scandinavian landscape mirrors the plight of mutually distrustful refugees.",1
"739","Trials Fusion is at once mercilessly exacting, and regularly thrilling.",1
"740","Elite: Dangerous is a beautiful game and an amazing space sim let down by a universe devoid of character and low on excitement.",0
"741","Its nature as a side-story to the HBO show means we won’t get to decide the fate of Westeros, but this introduction is convincing evidence that the future of House Forrester puts enough at stake to make choices matter.",1
"742","The Sly Collection succeeds where many before it have failed: it brings a classic console platforming series to the Vita with no crippling side effects. Despite some forgivable framerate issues, the enduring charm and intelligence of Sly Cooper’s design stole my heart once again.",1
"743","Its quirky humor – made all the better by excellent writing and interesting characters – is constantly unsettled by the seriousness of the plot, making for a unique adventure that Vita gamers owe it to themselves to experience.",1
"744","With only a brief introduction to Rhys and Fiona, they have already become a pair of my favorite Telltale characters, and the fantastic final scene of the Zer0 Sum has be anxiously awaiting my return trip to Pandora.",1
"745","Kirby Triple Deluxe may look great and has some clever ideas for how to use 3D, but falls into a rut of simple platforming and puzzles that rarely require any thought or skill. I admire that it tries to give us more powers and abilities to play with than ever before, but that empowerment shouldn’t come at the expense of any real difficulty.",0
"746","I have no doubt that the strength of the tactical combat will help find a strong niche, but for me, that just makes the relative weakness of the strategic side of gameplay all the more disappointing.",0
"747","It plays great, and it looks even better, but its advancements also beg it to be held to a higher standard, one that its overall story and morality systems struggle to reach.",1
"748","This year’s game is both exciting and reassuring that EA Sports isn’t wasting opportunities to improve the series.",1
"749","Everything that makes the Football Manager series so damned addictive remains completely intact and has been expanded upon in FM2015, but intelligent changes made to navigation and the way data is displayed makes for a much friendlier experience and speeds up seasons considerably.",1
"750","Feels very much like a send-off for the Rapture and Columbia eras of BioShock – a carefully crafted, appropriately mind-bending sendoff.",1
"751","While the few new mechanics that Pushmo World introduces are never fully utilized and a number of its puzzles feel a bit too familiar, the streamlined ability to create and share custom puzzles promises a virtually never-ending stream of new content to conquer.",1
"752","With an essential early-game choice that makes it worth playing through twice, the story at the center of Wolfenstein: The New Order props up its competent -- but mostly unremarkable -- shooting.",1
"753","Don’t be fooled by the simplicity of its pixels: no individual element of Dungeon of the Endless is especially complicated, but together they form a fiendish and unforgiving challenge.",1
"754","Superb gameplay, a breakneck pace and terrifying enemies makes The Evil Within a wonderful survival horror experience.",1
"755","It’s Adventure mode is beautifully designed, and new power-ups and character abilities switch up the usual bread-and-butter platforming gameplay, but it’s let down by limited options for co-operative play and most significantly, a number of game-breaking bugs on the PlayStation 4.",0
"756","It’s a shame that Isolation doesn’t track stats, because I’d be curious to know how many of its roughly 15-20 hours I spent hiding in lockers, staring at the motion tracker, and, most of all, how many hundreds (yes, hundreds) of times I died without a chance to save myself.",0
"757","It sacrifices some of both series’ challenge, and the alternate-universe story feels like a missed opportunity where there could have been more meaningful interaction between the worlds of Wright and Layton.",1
"758","The later levels lose some of the over-the-top fun of the earlier ones, but overall, Trials Fusion offers a fun, deeply challenging experience with lots to see and do.",1
"759","OlliOlli only does one thing, but it does it with style and grace. The trick system, while initially off-putting, strikes a near perfect balance of technique, creativity, and precision without coming off as overwhelming or obtuse.",1
"760","All of this, peppered into in-game and pre-rendered cutscenes, makes The New Order feel surprisingly human, and your situation quite desperate.",1
"761","If it’s impossible to dismiss the allure of authentic chants, stadia, team names, and kits, it’s telling that PES 2015 is intrinsically rewarding enough not to require those hooks. Strip away the fripperies and there’s a clear winner – and this year, for once, it isn’t EA Sports.",1
"762","Defense Grid 2 is just as addictive as 2008's Defense Grid: Awakening, but lacks the original's surprising heart.",1
"763","Someday, someone is going to make an incredible Alien video game that checks every box. But, sadly, Isolation is not it.",0
"764","This is perhaps the most heartbreaking and tense episode of anything Telltale has ever made. How Clementine braces for the impact of everything in front of her is up to you -- and where that takes her left me in awe.",1
"765","By designing the levels in the campaign, co-op, and multiplayer to facilitate those new mechanics, Advanced Warfare is granted a weight and importance that changes how the fast-paced shooting action feels in all three modes.",1
"766","At times it becomes a mind-numbing slog, as you're reduced to performing the same rote set of actions for hours until you perfect the one jump or dodge that's holding you back. The reward is a sense of mastery, but the price can be awfully steep, making this a true test of skill – and patience.",1
"767","While its slightly unbalanced design holds it back from being a genuine classic, it nonetheless does enough right to put a swagger back in Strider’s step for the first time in decades.",1
"768","You don’t have to be a hardcore golf fan to get hooked on Mario Golf: World Tour. It rewards good play, gives plenty to do, and is a great teacher. Its incremental approach to challenge kept me coming back to test myself, and the post-game challenges and multiplayer modes inspired me to play in new ways even after I thought I was a pro.",1
"769","While I appreciate the world, atmosphere, and mechanics, I can't help but wish that there was a light at the end of Don't Starve's dark and lonely tunnel.",1
"770","The slightly lower resolution is the only noticeable difference between the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of Watch Dogs, and I doubt I’d have picked up on it if I hadn’t just come from playing the PS4 version.",1
"771","For the first time in years, Grid Autosport feels like a Codemasters racing game built to appeal to long-time Codemasters racing fans.",1
"772","Episode 4: Amid the Ruins is the weakest episode of The Walking Dead: Season 2. Despite its major changes -- both regarding Clementine as a character and the roles of those around her -- there are too many out-of-left-field events to build tension convincingly.",0
"773","The abundance of inventive and genuinely fun characters, and the inclusion of playable villains, means there’s always some amazing new trick to try. The new versions of Skystones and tilting lock puzzles are fun enough that I’d play them by themselves. On the downside, there’s nothing new here for your existing Skylanders, and the overall story just fails to come together.",1
"774","A good game in a great series, but it only gets a qualified recommendation because of its weak naval warfare and its lack of several clever features that distinguish its predecessors.",1
"775","Game of Thrones Ep 1: Iron from Ice is a strong start for Telltale's adventure in George R. R. Martin's fantasy world.",1
"776","Crimes and Punishments offers a huge advance in graphics and gameplay for the Sherlock Holmes adventure series, and is well worth playing for longtime fans -- especially if they’re playing on a new-gen console or PC.",1
"777","There’s not much of a challenge or a reason to revisit once you’ve finished, but the story alone is worth experiencing. Ultimately, it’s a game about warfare that’s more interested in the people and their experiences, than bullets and their targets.",1
"778","Balance issues and multiplayer bugs remain, but there's enough variety found in its tower defense scenarios and three classes to warrant donning the legendary monster hunter's hat either again or for the very first time.",0
"779","With just the right pace, an appropriate level of challenge, and some customization options that make it much more than just another old-school side-scroller, Azure Striker Gunvolt comes heavily recommended to those that want to relive a sliver of the platformer golden era.",1
"780","It’s slightly off-putting that it definitely takes too long to get to the higher levels, and consequently that it strays close to undermining that desire to instantly have “just one more go.” The overall quality of the matching experience was ultimately strong enough to pull me back, largely helped by the smart secondary Puzzle Mode.",0
"781","NEO Scavenger is a deep, exciting sandbox for discovery with some truly surprising and inspired moments of storytelling. Its detailed and gritty survival mechanics bring an edge of realism, but often serve as a daunting barrier to some of the best parts of the story.",1

"785","D4 is an intriguing experience, and brimming with personality. It’s also the most polished game from Access to date, with a genuinely first-rate presentation.",0
"786","It’s mostly the moments in between battles that bring the whole experience down, as a lack of information and poor menus tarnish this flying ace.",0
"787","It’s a complex production that boils down simply to this: Destiny is a mechanically excellent, visually evocative FPS housed within an under-developed RPG framework. The endgame might hook you for the long haul once you fully understand it, but Destiny is ultimately unable to be all the different games it’s trying so hard to be.",1
"788","It lacks environmental variety and a sense of fairness when it comes to some of the boss battles, but it shows great potential for a revitalized series.",1
"789","Garden Warfare respects its roots by preserving its characters and their humor and skillfully adapting their charm to a third-person shooter...The solid controls, fun modes, and varied map design make it a good shooter to boot.",1
"790","Smoke and Mirrors is a great second act to The Wolf Among Us. Its 90 minutes are packed with memorable characters and scenes, as well as some of the most agonizing decisions Telltale has ever forced me to make.",1
"791","Character customization adds unique flavor to the simple combat, and the satisfying weapons, rewards, and story make it a fun alternative to the typically serious Zelda games. It’s just a shame you can’t share the action with a friend without significant slowdown.",0
"792","A Big Boss/Snake adventure has never looked or played better, and in it lies incredible promise for its enormous big brother.",1

"794","Hohokum is one of those games that could only have been created by a small team, so distinct are the voices within the presentation and design.",1
"795","Ground Zeroes is a short but challenging game, and those willing to cast aside conventional expectations will find a lot more here than first glance might suggest.",1
"796","It will probably hold my interest far longer than Tropico 4 did. But at the same time, it's rough edges are a continual annoyance. The larger issue is that while Tropico 5 definitely introduces some new challenges and ideas, it's still a dangerously simple city-builder.",0
"797","It starts out strong with dozens of hidden gags hidden among the scenery, but unfortunately it loses its momentum once minigames start to dominate its three-hour running time.",0
"798","The half-baked nature of Destiny's RPG elements are just a symptom of a far larger issue: This is a game that’s straddling the borders between too many kinds of experiences, and in its attempts to have something for everyone, it never fully satisfies on any one front.",1
"799","A brutal, challenging, and remarkably fun game. Its eerie world and imaginative enemies are genuinely frightening, and the scares are heightened significantly by the scarcity of resources at your disposal.",1
"800","Ultimately, I never felt like I got “good” at Fenix Rage, only occasionally lucky.",0
"801","Playing the Definitive Edition reminded me how much I enjoyed its excellent story and characters, combat, and city, but also made me pine for a true new-gen sequel.",1
"802","In Sheep’s Clothing still features Telltale’s strong writing, but is ultimately my least favorite chapter of the series so far. The lack of meaningful choices and scant story progression make Episode 4 feel unimportant in the grand scheme of things.",0
"803","Road Not Taken is a[n] interesting mix of ideas that make a strong first impression but don’t quite come together.",0

"805","Dead Nation on PlayStation 4 is just as great as it is on PlayStation 3. It's still eerie, difficult, and a ton of fun to play, whether online with your friends or on your own in a dimly-lit room.",1
"806","For those of us weaned on old-school click-and-point adventures (or anyone who wants to experience Sierra On-Line’s glory days), there’s no question - this is a must-play. The rest of you may be fascinated by its anachronisms, but still be dazzled by its dramatic story and classic puzzles.",0
"807","Though it feels like it moves a step back in the series’ multiplayer potential, the hundreds of dance moves, great progression between difficulties, and the more realized Fitness mode pick up the slack.",0
"808","Navigation is iffy, and the healing system is a bit broken even after a major revision, but its humor and personality shine through to make this a good Halloween bounty.",1

"815","Though the pacing is sluggish and some of the quests a little too redundant, the kooky characters, silly humor, and incredibly addictive gameplay kept me fishing and forging well after the final credits rolled.",1
"816","There's constantly a hook that keeps me coming back for more, even if it means sitting through another chunk of tedious story.",1
"817","Hack N’Slash is both a perfect pun and an amazingly clever game; one that does have a tendency to get so wrapped up in being clever that the gameplay suffers for it, unless you and its creators are on the exact same wavelength, but which does at least let you feel smart as well.",1
"818","Delivers entertaining hack-and-slash combat centered on combos and spells, but its risk-based reward system seems slightly out of place in a world where its hero so easily achieves great power and defense and makes risk obsolete.",0
"819","I like Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham, but I don’t love it as much as I’ve loved previous games in the series.",0
"820","The developers – aptly named Ragequit – focused on the big picture, which is wonderfully captured dogfights between megabots, but they've neglected to tie all its complex pieces together with a useful tutorial.",1
"821","As a pure city-building game, Banished is dazzling. It combines simple charms with transparent, complex systemic interactions, and a tough-but-fair difficulty curve.",1
"822","Infamous: First Light is a decent story around a better character than Second Son, but its battles don’t have the same scale or superpower variety that Second Son’s do. After the short campaign, its challenge maps put a new spin on combat by taking away your ability to escape danger on a whim, making it much tougher.",1
"823","Both God of War 1 and 2 are incredible games that deserve the best possible treatment. Unfortunately, the Vita version of God of War Collection just doesn't do the series justice.",0
"824","Judged on its own, Dreamfall Chapters - Book One: Reborn falls flat, and will confuse series newcomers.",0
"825","A noble attempt at creating a new kind of science-fiction strategy game that’s sadly weaker than the sum of its parts.",0
"826","The real treasure in Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris wasn't Lara’s story, bipedal alligator warriors, or a bounty of gems, but solving complex and varied environmental puzzles with friends.",1
"827","MouseCraft is a thoughtful puzzle game with challenging levels and some clever features. While customizable controls and a little more information on the level-select screen would have removed some significant annoyances, the overall enjoyment of easily being able to drop in to any level (including some I made myself) and guide my mice to their prize is good fun.",1
"828","Mighty Gunvolt is short, but sweet. It's not incredibly difficult, but it's not necessarily meant to be, either. It's an experience more than a full-fledged game, a taste of what Inti Creates is capable of when they strip everything away and go back to the 8-bit style and aesthetic they proved to know so much about when creating Mega Man 9 and 10.",1
"829","The storytelling presumes you already know the source material by heart, which means things are sometimes a bit disjointed, and the game, like the movies it’s based on, ends at an awkward place. But like almost all the Lego games, this is a journey worth taking.",0
"830","Though Black deserves credit for adding new puzzle mechanics along the way, it could’ve easily seen its 6-8 hour runtime chopped in half and still gotten its message across.",0
"831","The scope is stunning, the customization is satisfying, and the multiplayer touches upon some really ambitious ideas. But the lack of a strong main character or interesting take on the Assassin’s Creed universe costs it momentum and excitement, and the persistent control problems are still a thorn in its side.",1
"832","Its sharp wit and bevy of nerd-culture references offset the frustration that arises from an unrelentingly challenging dungeon crawler.",0
"833","MouseCraft is a thoughtful puzzle game with challenging levels and some clever features.

"834","Relatively simplistic compared to the N64-era shooters that inspired it, Screencheat nevertheless distinguishes itself with goofy charm, fast pacing, and a clever gameplay hook based on invisibility.",0
"835","Styx may stumble in its quicktime combat and its spotty edge detection, but it makes up for most of its flaws with challenging stealth action across massives levels.",0
"836","Uneven and undercooked, Disney Infinity 2.0 isn’t the major upgrade I expected. It lacks the playful fun and diversity that made Infinity 1.0 so great last year.",0
"837","Nintendo gets a lot out of mileage out of this Sims-like concept, but still manages to find ways to make it simple, accessible, and entertaining.",1
"838","It’s a well put-together, decently entertaining, and entirely unambitious demon-slaying action game with neither the depth and character of Monster Hunter nor the arresting, gruesome strangeness of Soul Sacrifice. There’s better than this available on the Vita.",0
"839","As an old-school dungeon crawling experience that doesn't shy away from punishing you for errors, Legacy usually delivers.",0
"840","Its strong character progression and combat systems better suit the offline Elder Scrolls games than in most MMOs, but it’s very much a game about adventuring with other players.",1
"841","That said, the tentacles of Driveclub can grip tight if you get invested in the game’s asynchronous challenges, and it’s very much geared around encouraging us to hop online and compete by making it so easy.",1
"842","The LEGO Movie Videogame extends a concise and hilarious film into a much longer and less consistent interactive experience that sometimes dips into boring territory.",0
"843","The skeleton-shattering, long-distance kills are still its riveting centerpiece, of course, but even without the element of dumb fun they offer, Sniper Elite III would still be a smart, unexpectedly memorable experience.",1
"844","The PC version of Unity requires a pretty hefty rig to run, and an even heftier one is recommended. That said, those of you who have access to this will find that Unity on PC looks even better than its console brethren thanks to being able to run at resolutions above 900p, enhanced textures, and (hardware permitting) a much higher frame rate than the locked 30fps of the Xbox One and PS4.",1
"845","Make no mistake: to pull off everything that Dead State tries would be an achievement for any RPG, and it’s impressive how much it manages. What it lacks in polish it at least largely makes up for in personality, even with glitches and rough edges as far as the eye can see.",0
"846","Better and more focused than its precursor. The slow, calculated multiplayer matches afford plenty of opportunity for strategic fun, though the single-player mode is more a tutorial than a substantial component.",1
"847","Demon Gaze shouldn’t be as entertaining as it is, but its addicting nature and substantial length make it an ideal RPG for the Vita.",0
"848","The same great game it is on Xbox One, but prettier. On the other side of that coin, it includes the same issues with the map design feeling maze-like and confusing, but no other game does huge hordes of zombies quite like this one.",1
"849","With a bit more polish applied to its presentation and the addition of a career mode to keep us hooked, this could well have been a package to seriously threaten EA’s dominance in the world of golf games. As it stands, it’s still a strong foundation for the team at HB Studios to build upon for the future.",0
"850","Though its overeagerness to hand out points and make everyone feel like a winner robs it of some competitive value, Just Dance 2015 just works as a fun, get-up-and-move game, with a wink and smile along the way.",1
"851","Between the hit-or-miss missions is an extremely annoying city hub map and a weak story full of bland characters, and Garrett himself isn’t as sure-footed as a master thief ought to be. Ignoring the story and cherrypicking the best side missions is the best way to approach it.",0
"852","EA Sports UFC looks the part to a tee, and its exhaustive list of moves and techniques represent the complex nature of the sport well. But knowing that each second could be your fighter’s last is what gives weight and drama to mixed martial arts, and without that, these bouts fall flat.",0
"853","It’s a good start to what may eventually be expanded into a great Sims game, but it’s not there yet.",1
"854","Apart from some minor hiccups in large crowds and certain Synchronization points, there weren’t any annoying performance issues.",1
"855","The standard match-three gameplay is layered with strategy that uses to the main series’ established rock-paper-scissor combat system, but the UI’s lack of information leaves those without an encyclopedic knowledge of Pokemon games at a disadvantage.",0
"856","I love the amount of respect the developers clearly have for every aspect of the sport, but reverence and attention to detail alone can’t stand in for a missing sense of danger and excitement.",0
"857","Ignoring the story and cherrypicking the best side missions is the best way to approach it.",0
"858","Abyss Odyssey has everything it needs to be a great Roguelike, except the most important - a reason to keep coming back. While it lasts, it’s a gorgeous journey with great ideas and atmosphere, and in time, it may evolve into something with more longevity.",0
"859","The storytelling presumes you already know the source material by heart, which means things are sometimes a bit disjointed, and the game, like the movies it’s based on, ends at an awkward place. But like almost all the Lego games, this is a journey worth taking.",0
"860","Filled with interesting ideas, Murasaki Baby's dazzling animation and unique approach to platforming are enticing.",1
"861","It’s still enjoyable and super adorable, which makes it worth the playthrough if you’re looking for light, easy fun.",0
"862","Magicka: Wizard Wars is a great platform for PvP wizardry, but it makes for a thin MOBA. It's still enjoyable when you find yourself in a good game, but a shoddy server situation and nonexistent community policing makes those way too rare.",0
"863","The simplistic art style of Minimum isn't a turn off in the slightest. Surprisingly, it's the melee swords that end up being a huge imbalancing factor in combat that deflates the fun of the fast-paced gunplay.",0
"864","Young Horses has done an excellent job taking the diamond in the rough that was the original Octodad student project and turning it into a short but charmingly absurdist physics game.",1
"865","Lichdom: Battlemage suffers from an over-reliance on linear level design and samey enemy types, but few other games deliver such a memorable brand of action-packed magic combat.",0
"866","Amusing scenarios and eye-catching environments are a plus, as is the wide unlockable hero roster, but most of the missions feel like an unimaginative retread of the same LEGO game formula.",0
"867","An abusive classic, but still. If you remember it fondly, it’s both a return trip and a good chunk more of the same, beautifully drawn and well made, despite a clumsy UI and a few annoyances.",0
"868","Metrico is an ingenious and unique Vita puzzler heavily weighed down by gimmicky controls and technical issues.",0
"869","Extends a concise and hilarious film into a much longer and less consistent interactive experience that sometimes dips into boring territory...It's solidly enjoyable – but nowhere near awesome.",0
"870","Gauntlet can't quite strike the balance between the nostalgic arcade experience and a modern-day replay-friendly adventure. It's cool that there's such a varied experience amongst the iconic quartet of heroes, and four-player co-op is almost always fun with the right crew, but its repetitive structure works against its longevity.",0
"871","A few weird design choices in regards to the health system and navigation meant that just a bit too much of that time was spent backtracking and squinting at a map, but its humor and personality shine through to make this a good Halloween bounty.",1
"872","Every aspect -- from the humor to the puzzles to the live action cutscenes -- feels beamed here straight from the ‘90s. Sometimes it’s charming, and others, it’s just dated. But if nothing else, Tex’s puns and underdog relatability ultimately still make this rocky, uneven case worth cracking.",0
"873","Dead Nation on PS Vita isn't as strong as it is on PS3 and PS4, but it's still a lot of fun to play. It's eerie and difficult, whether online with a friend or on your own in a dimly-lit room.",1
"874","A faithful (perhaps too faithful) translation of a mildly fun tabletop experience saddled with simplistic, repetitive objectives.",0
"875","The excessive micromanagement and often vexing pace of combat tarnish the tactical depth created by cool officer abilities and unit variety.",0
"876","I wanted to love Sword Art Online: Hollow Fragment for its enjoyable exploration and addictive combat. Unfortunately, the embarrassing romance system, confusing Hollow Missions and wonky translation overshadowed any fun I was having.",0
"877","Battle Grounds may have nice animations, interesting, old-school-inspired environments, and the heart of a classic beat-'em-up, but its gameplay pales in comparison to its more quality-oriented, difficult, and well-balanced competition. It's an easy, almost mindless romp.",0
"878","Sniper Elite III's open level designs and objectives pack in more than enough variety and stealthy tension to counterbalance its thin story and shaky enemy intelligence, and experimenting with its explosive traps is almost as fun as popping skulls with a sniper rifle.",1
"879","Between the hit-or-miss missions is an extremely annoying city hub map and a weak story full of bland characters, and Garrett himself isn’t as sure-footed as a master thief ought to be.",0
"880","A good game with its heart in the right place. Its Cold War premise is brilliant, its art is beautiful, and its music is lovely. When it comes to gameplay, the stealth action sputters a bit in its inconsistent AI and inaccurate aiming, but it still delivers a fun experience.",0
"881","It’s true that this surprisingly feature-packed portable effort does have a few issues - the small text and fiddly touch controls being the main offenders - but the core experience of tactical battles, financial and man management remains as addictive as ever.",1
"882","Its story is sparse and the impact of its conclusion isn’t fully worked through, yet it’s worth playing for the way in which it manipulates perspective and transforms everyday locations into nightmarish reflections.",0
"883","While the intriguing fighting game veneer manages to frame the gameplay in a clever way, the mechanics never actually evolve beyond the standard ""hit this button at this time"" formula.",0
"884","As great as it would be to hold up Consortium as the next great evolution of adventure/RPG, it's not, though it is a valiant attempt that deserves praise.",0
"885","Its craft is sloppy, its design remains shackled by ill-conceived new ideas, as well as the limitations of the platform it hails from.",0

"887","Mystery of the Mooil Rig may end too quickly, but you'll enjoy the ride.",1
"888","The plot never ramps up, the characters barely change, and the choice to make most NPCs a shopkeep and/or teacher makes equipping and learning new skills a mess, all of which keep Risen 3 from - ahem - rising to modern RPG expectations.",0
"889","Playing as a diver or a shark is a fast, fun, and frantic experience, and each has its own feel and set of skills.",1
"890","Yoshi’s New Island’s inconsistent art and tacked-on new ideas are all layered on top of the same strong platforming and level design that made the original great. This deep understanding of pacing and flow helps Yoshi’s latest adventure stand out as the best iteration on Yoshi since the SNES original. Even if I wanted to play with the sound turned off.",1
"891","With a bit more polish applied to its presentation and the addition of a career mode to keep us hooked, this could well have been a package to seriously threaten EA’s dominance in the world of golf games. As it stands, it’s still a strong foundation for the team at HB Studios to build upon for the future.",0
"892","Abnormally complex and pretty for a twin-stick arena shooter, Secret Ponchos throws you into the deep end and demands you figure things out for yourself, usually while under heavy fire. Stick it out, however, and the real fun starts to shine through.",0
"893","Very little of what’s made it a blast to play over the last couple of years hasn’t been poisoned by this version’s technical issues. Its compromised visuals rob it of much of its bombastic charm, while its erratic performance and unreliable touch controls keep the gameplay from shining like it has in the past.",0
"894","It's unpretentious and straight-forward in its delivery, and yet, underneath its façade rests an addictive top-down shooter with solid mechanics and a hardcore slant.",1
"895","By utilizing time and resource management, inside claustrophobic and violent situations, it builds tension and instills panic like very few games.",1
"896","The Dark Below is a huge missed opportunity, a mish-mash of recycled ideas and content that fails to reinvigorate Destiny or address any of its biggest problems.",0
"897","As a stealth game, Sir, You Are Being Hunted is a refreshingly different and unscripted approach with a haunting but still light-hearted atmosphere.",1
"898","It’s certainly different, but it’s also throwaway.",0
"899","Goat Simulator isn’t much of a game, but it’s a hell of a good time. The small but dense map is packed with tons of jokes and bugs that should be seen rather than talked about, and there’s at least a few hours’ worth of entertainment in goofing around with the jetpack alone.",1
"900","Continue?9876543210 is arty game that actually attempts to challenge us, yet their short, repetitive, ritualistic nature can interrupt the themes that make this a unique and interesting game.",1
"901","While the wrestlers look amazing and the combat feels significantly better, MyCareer mode is an absolute slog and everything else has been done better in previous years.",0
"902","Boston Lockdown has a serviceable story, but its lack of branching dialogue options and its heavy emphasis on combat render it a less satisfying experience compared to its recent Shadowrun peers.",0
"903","Kinect Sports Rivals isn’t the Kinect’s killer app, but it comes closer than anything else I’ve played. The various games, aside from soccer, feel great to play and offer more control than I expected. And even though the challenge grows in later levels, I felt like I was able to maneuver through them without fighting the controls.",0
"904","It's not a world that I want to stick around to save.",0
"905","It plays extremely well, whether online or offline, proving why EA Sports' long-running series has been the king of the ice for over 20 years. But there needs to be a reason to keep playing, and it's there that NHL 15 falls short and feels somewhat vacant.",0
"906","Mind Zero is an enjoyable dungeon crawler with engaging battles, lively voice acting, and oodles of exploration.",0
"907","I had some fun free-to-play battles with Loadout, but far more time was spent mired in frustration or feeling under-fulfilled with a purchased campaign victory; it's not quite ""pay to win,"" but it definitely is ""pay to win with a lot less hassle.""",0
"908","Although NBA Live 15 looks significantly better than NBA Live 14 at a glance, it still suffers from clumsy controls and stiff animations. A few nice changes and additional game modes can’t make up for poor gameplay, but there are some great ideas here that just don’t get a chance to shine.",0
"909","Being a ghost in Murdered is enjoyable in fits and starts, yet the use of your powers is brutally limited, resulting in an almost entirely scripted and therefore watered-down afterlife experience.",0
"910","There are some great concepts in Murdered: Soul Suspect, but they feel undercooked or underutilised, and the lack of demand for any real input from us makes Murdered feel like a pick-a-path game where there’s only one path.",0
"911","There's a wonderful nugget at its core, but the final product, when all features and factors combine, never shines enough to recommend it without a series of caveats.",0
"912","A beautifully detailed, enjoyably shallow experience that's better with friends. Sacred 2 fans hoping for a real action-RPG likely won't be pleased, but as a simple, straightforward slash-'em-up, this stands ably enough on its own.",0
"913","The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is available for all major platforms, but outside of the unflinching framerate, which stays steady no matter how fast Spidey swings, I wasn’t all that impressed by its looks on PC or newer consoles.",0

"915","Bound By Flame’s combination of progression and action ultimately make it greater than the sum of its parts.",0
"916","While Escape Dead Island’s workmanlike combat and ho-hum zombies fail to fully capitalize on this unoriginal but respectably executed premise, it does manage to punctuate its enjoyable filler with some genuinely spectacular moments of madness.",0
"917","Daylight has a good foundation of scary atmosphere and interesting bits of story. All of that is squandered by the first half, where poor level design, unnecessary box-pushing puzzles, and impotent enemies deflate the scares before it even gets going. By the time I reached the more interesting second act, I’d grown immune to its tricks and could only see it as a mediocre series of fetch quests.",0
"918","It scrapes by on the power of its central whodunnit mystery, but I can’t help but feel that Murdered: Soul Suspect is ten hours worth of unfinished business.",0
"919","A bizarre game that works on paper but much less on screen. At first glance it's fun, but after a while it loses its steam and it becomes tedious and frustrating.",0
"920","The next time there's an Amazing Spider-Man movie, hopefully combat can be brought up to snuff, since there's plenty of promise in the air.",0
"921","It’s especially frustrating because the web swinging really is fun, but developer Beenox wasn’t able to keep the momentum going once you hit the ground.",0

"923","It’s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way, but it’s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope, and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem...It is one of the very best video games ever made.",1
"924","Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain is a gameplay marvel, rewarding intelligence and creativity in a way few games do.",1
"925","Even if the plot isn’t terribly interesting, the many characters who play a part in it are, and along with the excellent combat and RPG gameplay, they elevate The Witcher 3 to a plane few other RPGs inhabit.",1
"926","There have certainly been sandbox action games that have given me a bigger world to roam, or more little icons to chase on my minimap, but none have pushed me to plan, adapt, and improvise the way this one does. Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain doesn’t just respect my intelligence as a player, it expects it of me, putting it in league that few others occupy.",1
"927","If you missed it on PS3, do yourself a favor and experience it on PS4. If you did play on PS3, you now own it on PS4, so this minimal graphical update is an excellent excuse to revisit it.",1
"928","There’s an incredible power to unlocking its mysteries, and in succeeding, despite its demand for a pound of your flesh.",1
"929","Even if the plot isn’t terribly interesting, the many characters who play a part in it are, and along with the excellent combat and RPG gameplay, they elevate The Witcher 3 to a plane few other RPGs inhabit.",1
"930","It's hard to express just how much I adore Undertale without spoiling anything significant, but that's what I love about it. It tells its story in such a dynamic way, and with such a great understanding of the RPG player’s mindset, that it couldn’t have been told in any other way. It's a masterfully crafted experience that I won't forget any time soon.",1
"931","Massive in size, and meticulously detailed, The Witcher 3 ends Geralt's story on a high note.",1
"932","The Witcher 3: Hearts of Stone wraps an interesting story and great gameplay additions into one well-rounded expansion.",1
"933","Despite some cumbersome menus and a single drag of a dungeon, Majora’s Mask is a great adventure that (repeatedly) stands the test of time.",1
"934","It honors the classics, brings great ideas of its own, and in the process it emerges as a classic itself. Games like this are always about the journey, and it's sure as hell a journey worth taking.",1
"935","The crown jewel is King's Fall, a demanding high-level activity that, despite the strict six-person requirement, will keep me playing into the late hours of the night.",1
"936","Even the technical shakiness that crops up here and there can’t even begin to slow down its momentum.",1
"937","Its action is brutal, over-the-top, and rewarding; a hyperactive arcade-style shoot-em-up with enough dynamism to keep me captivated moment to moment, but a strong sense of strategy to give me something to invest in over longer playthroughs.",1
"938","There will always be more levels to play thanks to the online creation community, and a virtually endless pool of challenges to overcome.",1
"939","You can find RPGs that are prettier, more accessible, or less busy, but very few are as dedicated to the true spirit of role-playing as this one is.",1
"940","Kerbal Space Program does the improbable: it makes learning a complex subject fun. Its cute, clueless characters and sense of humor turn a hardcore physics simulator into something replayable and addictive.",1
"941","If you want the RPG with the most skills, the most stats to consider, and a world that constantly makes meaningful use of every line on your character sheet, there’s nothing else quite like Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition.",1
"942","It's often frustrating and sometimes confusing, but its spectacular platforming, memorable world, and engrossing story wash those concerns away.",1
"943","Legacy of the Void offers tons of StarCraft 2 fun for both casual and hardcore RTS players.",1
"944","A dense, intriguing, but ultimately safe expansion, The Old Hunters is more of the same brutal Bloodborne experience.",1
"945","The logic used to dispatch enemies should ideally play out like a neat algorithm, flawlessly executed once you know their patterns and how to manipulate them. That’s not how it works, of course, as the dungeons are complicated, chaotic things, and players are forced to move at the whim of the soundtrack’s tempo, with little room for error. Logic meets chaos. It’s a tension evident in many games, and it’s exemplified wonderfully here.",1
"946","The addition of tank combat thematically clashes with everything Batman stands for, but it is fun, and having access to the Batmobile for the first time gives us a new world of possibilities for interacting with Gotham City. Arkham Knight is an outstanding game on almost every level.",1
"947","Like a big bucket of Hot Wheels brought to life, Forza Motorsport 6 is first-order car porn for the automobile obsessed but remains an accessible and exciting racer for those who just want to drive fast in something red with a horse logo on it.",1
"948","Hand on heart, I can’t remember ever being so consistently thrilled, surprised and delighted by a football game before.",1
"949","NBA 2K16 is one of the most complete packages I’ve ever seen. Developer Visual Concepts continues to raise the sports simulation bar by completely retooling its silky-smooth gameplay, adding brand-new physics systems, and refining its traditional game modes.",1
"950","Great new reasons to obsessively gather and hoard relics of happier times, strong companions, and sympathetic villains driving tough decisions make it an adventure I’ll definitely replay and revisit. Even the technical shakiness that crops up here and there can’t even begin to slow down its momentum.",1
"951","Episode 5: The Vault of the Traveler finishes off Rhys and Fiona’s journey in impeccable fashion. From heartbreak to hilarity, it runs the gamut of emotions in some really effective ways.",1
"952","These games have aged remarkably well, they’re still an absolute to play, and their characters are as charming and memorable as ever.",1
"953","Final Fantasy XIV: Heavensward doesn't make sweeping changes to A Realm Reborn aside from new jobs and flying mounts, but the outstanding story it tells and new lands we visit reinvigorate the adventure and demonstrate why Final Fantasy XIV is one of the best MMOs out there.",1
"954","Its beauty is more than skin deep, too. DmC already had one of the most elegant combat-control schemes of any action game to date, but this Definitive Edition adds a lock-on system. That makes it easier to track enemies and execute signature lunge moves like the Stinger, or to focus on the biggest threat in a group of enemies.",1
"955","Very few games can hook me in for 100 hours, but this installment adds enough new creatures, weapons, locations, and fighting moves to expand and reinvigorate my lust for the hunt.",1
"956","With a strong script, great use of FMV, and a simple yet empowering core game mechanic, Her Story is the most unique game I’ve played in years.",1
"957","Homeworld: The Remastered Collection does a fantastic job of polishing up and reintroducing these formerly hard-to-experience classic real-time strategy games.",1
"958","Rise of the Tomb Raider raises the bar set by Lara’s last outing with a rollicking adventure story, strong villains, gorgeous vistas, and smart puzzles – go off the main path to find the best stuff in dastardly optional tombs. Though the mandatory combat doesn’t distinguish itself with challenging enemies unless you crank up the difficulty, Lara’s newfound versatility on the battlefield makes fighting a lot more fun.",1
"959","Steamworld Heist stole my heart. The characters are charming, the combat is addictive, and the Firefly-style adventure made every battle a blast. Besides some annoying instances of post-battle maintenance, I rarely felt the need to power down these robots.",1
"960","An awesome upgrade that's addressed most of my biggest problems with Destiny over the past year.",1
"961","It’s a decent MOBA with some good ideas, and it has a promising patch-filled future, but they need refinement before Heroes of the Storm can join the big leagues.",0
"962","It’s an impressively layered game, and does a great job of tapping deep into the skater psyche, where an obsession with tricks and effortless style intersect.",1
"963","Its universe keeps getting harder and harder to take seriously, and its microtransactions are borderline gross, but Mortal Kombat X is a great fighting game all the same.",1
"964","Even though the New 3DS’ speedier hardware can’t make it look quite as good as it does on the Wii, its scope and scale still make it an impressive and deep game that’s well suited for play on the go.",1
"965","Dirt Rally is a brilliant looking and incredible sounding racing sim that feels absolutely outstanding, but it won’t tolerate the timid.",1
"966","Rocket League is a rare example where the execution of a simple, absurd idea is so strong and so engaging that it doesn’t need a ton of extra features around it.",1
"967","Don’t expect exciting scenarios or random events, but do expect to be impressed by the scale and many moving parts of this city-builder.",1
"968","Despite unreliable servers, Rocket League is a fast, fluid, absurdly good time with surprising mechanical depth.",1
"969","Mega Man Legacy Collection is an object lesson for how game compilations should be engineered, providing rock-solid adaptation to a new platform, respecting the material’s historic context, and exercising restraint.",1
"970","An incredible package. Its presentation is charming, the extras are amazing, and so many of the games included here are still a blast to play.",1
"971","Guardians’ multiplayer harkens back to the Halo 2 glory days with tons of balanced maps and fun modes, and the tactical new Warzone mode absolutely steals the show.",1
"972","While I wish it balanced it's lack of mission explanations with its overabundance of exposition, I still really enjoyed my time in its strange, yet familiar world",1
"973","Xenoblade Chronicles X is a massive RPG with enough surface area, sub quests, and customization to keep you busy.",1
"974","SOMA is smart and scary science fiction. Not all of its ideas work, but it's worth playing for the story alone.",1
"975","Time has done little to diminish Grim Fandango’s beauty or relevance. It is an adventure game not to be missed.",1
"976","The world, exploration, crafting, atmosphere, and story of Fallout 4 are all key parts of this hugely successful sandbox role-playing game. Great new reasons to obsessively gather and hoard relics of happier times, strong companions, and sympathetic villains driving tough decisions make it an adventure I’ll definitely replay and revisit",1
"977","Madden NFL 16's new throwing and passing game ramps up the risk, reward, and realism in new, exciting ways.",1
"978","The complete package is as substantial as ever, and those who’ve acclimatised to FIFA’s play style in recent years will likely consider it good enough. But in the face of much stronger competition, ‘good enough’ might not actually be good enough.",1
"979","Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster is already great way to play these classic RPGs on the PS3 and Vita, and the even prettier PlayStation 4 version comes with the visual improvements you’d expect for the new-generation platform.",1
"980","The sharper visuals, smooth 60-fps gameplay, and other features and enhancements gave me plenty of reasons to be happy about coming back, and to recommend that you pick it up for the first time.",1
"981","I just wish that the dating elements had been more smoothly incorporated into the established narrative and not forced (gruesomely at times) on the player. Sometimes, it’s enough to just be friends.",0
"982","Resident Evil does a good job of updating the look and feel of a classic survival horror game for a new audience.",1
"983","Deep and demanding but incredibly user-friendly, Project CARS looks great, sounds fantastic, and feels even better.",1
"984","Deep and demanding but incredibly user-friendly, Project CARS is real racing done right.",1
"985","Story only matters so much in a fighting game. Combat is king, and there’s a ton of depth to mine from Mortal Kombat X.",1
"986","Madden NFL 16's new throwing and passing game ramps up the risk, reward, and realism in new, exciting ways.",1
"987","A thrilling turn-based spy game. Though it fails to tap its colorful characters for story material and personality beyond their unique abilities, its randomized maps and spy equipment make sneaking past the enemy AI for maximum profit a tough and repeatable challenge.",1
"988","Gears' strong style and great gameplay make it enjoyable even today, nine years after the original was released.",1
"989","With its biggest rival matching its dynamism and beating it for fluidity and responsiveness, EA Sports has work to do if FIFA is to regain its title as king of the digital sport.",1
"990","The fact that it collects every piece of DLC for both games, the majority of which is of very high quality, plus the fact that you can carry your last-gen saves and characters over, makes it a good pickup for returning fans and a great pickup for new ones.",1
"991","Etrian Odyssey is a meaty adventure with dozens of dungeon floors and bone-crushing challenges to overcome with its competent turn-based combat. The story isn’t perfect, but I was happily kept busy with exploring the world, battling bosses, and feeding the hungry citizens of my hubtown.",0
"992","This tale is funny, beautiful, and challenging enough to make up for a few plodding quests and frequent load screens, and it maintains its personality from start to finish, sprinkling the first episode of its story with happy highs and tragic lows.",1
"993","Progressively mastering its wonderful controls and unlocking new upgrades had me totally hooked, and even though its idea of mission variety is something of an illusion, its smart, playful personality kept me too entertained to care.",1
"994","Resident Evil relies on atmosphere, tough limitations, and danger creeping around all corners, and this port recaptures the formula of a classic, relentless survival-horror game.",1
"995","Some of the older visual flaws detract from the experience and pulled me out of tense moments, but the gameplay hooked me right back in.",1
"996","What it lacks in new features it makes up for in improving old ones, such as a better experiences in the Matrix as well as improved interface options.",1
"997","Nintendo’s take on the third-person shooter is refreshingly original, but it needs more modes and content.",1
"998","Tearaway Unfolded is a big and bold adaptation, but lacks some of the original's intimate charm.",1
"999","From its four-player co-op campaign to the brand-new powers and a fleshed-out Zombies mode, Black Ops 3 meaningfully pushes the Call of Duty series forward on several fronts. Even where it doesn't innovate, it still meets the high bar Call of Duty fans should expect.",1
"1000","The people at the center of this story are so engaging that I’m starting to outright ignore awkward dialogue, because the emotional gravity of its storytelling is so much stronger than the irregular out-of-place line or questionable dialogue delivery.",1
"1001","A grueling, rewarding racer. The temptation to chuck a controller across the room after instantly jumping from first to last will likely strike a handful of times, and it's a bit thin on customization options, but when all of its high notes line up, Fast Racing Neo is an exhilarating, devilishly grueling game that absolutely pulses with energy.",1
"1002","The new guitar makes a tangible improvement to how you experience each and every riff and lick, and GHTV provides an almost irresistible service for enjoying tracks you love while discovering new ones, with absolutely nothing hidden behind a paywall.",1
"1003","Adding three different and fun vehicles and extremely creative level designs to the series’ simple but reliably enjoyable action platforming gives Skylanders SuperChargers a healthy boost.",1
"1004","It isn’t the prettiest game you can play on PS4, PS3 or Vita, but Helldivers is one of the most exhilarating, and you’ll get all three versions for the price of one.",1
"1005","Episode 3 balances humor and drama to deliver the best chapter of the series so far.",1
"1006","An emotional intro and devastating outro show how well Dontnod can handle both separately, but the hours in between leave so much to be desired in terms of marrying these people to their story.",0
"1007","It does a good job of overcoming these shortcomings with an entertaining story, a fun new class, generally attractive elite specializations, and a new vertical focus on exploration.",1
"1008","The action is ferocious and tactical, the weather effects are awesome, and it’s brimming with content to explore. This is real racing done right.",1
"1009","The Vanishing of Ethan Carter was an amazing achievement on PC, and remains just as great on PS4.",1
"1010","This is Wargaming's richest and most rewarding team game to date, with the most diverse set of classes and skills of any of its games.",1
"1011","Black Ops 3 isn't the best Call of Duty game ever, but it's the biggest and most feature-packed game we've seen out of the series yet.",1
"1012","Its beautiful graphics are prettier than ever, and a higher frame rate adds more fluidity to the action. The story will be confusing to newcomers, as it picks up right in the middle of the saga, but the exciting combat and epic set pieces hold up exceptionally well.",1
"1013","All these adjustments to animation, dribbling, and shooting lead to what EA is calling Moments of Magic, which feels like a misguided attempt to define something that’sbeen part of FIFA for years.",1
"1014","Few franchises can get away with feeling this similar from version to version, but Disgaea is just that deep, requiring you to understand and exploit character stats, equipment attributes, and class abilities at a level most modern RPGs have abandoned in the name of accessibility.",1
"1015","A few difficulty spikes threaten to spoil the colorful, effervescent fun in Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime’s frantic cooperative 2D-shooter action, but its novel core emphasis on relying on coordination with another player or an AI partner to overcome such challenges is usually strong enough to overcome the occasional frustration.",1
"1016","Volume may suffer from a few issues of poorly designed AI and easily exploited level design, but I still found a great number of challenging rooms with an intriguing story to match, and plenty of room to master.",1
"1017","Disney Infinity 3.0 sees the pop culture powerhouse flexing its formidable mega franchise muscles with impressive results. It’s a game that doesn’t just encourage the player to have fun, it insists on it; offering up a generous helping of gameplay and countless things to unlock even before you start piling on all the optional add-ons.",1
"1018","Environmental puzzles function similarly, and are bigger and more involved than in previous episodes.",1
"1019","While the puzzles that required physically moving the pieces became tedious, the act of exploring dozens of locations based on things I’ve adored since my childhood was genuinely entertaining.",1
"1020","Minor quibbles aside, The Handsome Collection is a great package for any console-bound Borderlands fan.",1
"1021","There's a lot to enjoy here, and for newer players who need a little early help, (or for turtlers who prefer to hold on to what they have), the British Forces are a godsend.",1
"1022","Dishonored Definitive Edition doesn’t live up to its name, but the core game and its DLC are still stylish and fun.",1
"1023","Other than functional online play, there’s nothing revolutionary about this year’s version. It does get to legitimately say that it looks and plays better than any other baseball game you can buy right now, but only slightly.",1
"1024","Mega Man Legacy Collection combines great emulation, remixes, and historic context into a superb compilation.",1
"1025","It still suffers technical problems with online play, which is a shame, because outside of noticeably repetitious play-by-play calling and some non-gameplay-affecting framerate issues in cutscenes and replays, NHL 16 is an otherwise excellent game.",1
"1026","Isolated technical glitches, an overly generous dealer, and simple combat dampen some of the fun, but the novelty of the design is usually strong enough to pull up the slack.",0
"1027","The fact that so little needed to be done to modernize it only reinforces its place as a classic of the genre.",1
"1028","Wasteland 2: Director's Cut presents much the same experience that impressed us last year, but here it's given a facelift that affects everything from its graphics to hours of new voiceover files.",1
"1029","It might not look like much, but BoxBoy is one of the cleverest puzzle platformers I’ve ever played.",1
"1030","Chaos Theory doesn’t bring many major moral choices to the table, but it doesn’t matter – Max’s evolving time-travel power is growing into something bigger and scarier than she ever expected.",1
"1031","Guitar Hero Live might not return the series to the heights of its heyday, but it’s definitely the freshest and boldest Guitar Hero game in a very long time.",1
"1032","Its stealthy gameplay, beautifully designed environments, and refreshingly grounded protagonist make it stand out from the main game, and a cliffhanger ending suggests there’s much more good stuff to come in part two: The Consequence.",1
"1033","Full of humor, heart, and beauty, King's Quest is a admirable revival of classic adventure games.",1
"1034","Attila is an adept refinement of Rome 2. From the desperately paced campaign map down to each individual skirmish on the ash-specked earth, it’s a cleaner, better thought-out experience.",1
"1035","Whether you're looking for casual action combat, or something to master through an investment of thousands of hours, Smite on the Xbox One is a well of frenetic action and smart strategy that runs as deep as you're willing to dive.",1
"1036","A marvelously creative, puzzling adventure that’s very mad at you.",1
"1037","Rock Band 4 makes smart choices in bringing the series back, even if its setlist is somewhat disappointing.",1
"1038","The use of different classes and the evocation of the Warhammer setting is enough to make Vermintide a competent twist on the Left 4 Dead formula, but it doesn't execute them well enough to live up to its inspiration.",0
"1039","It serves as a reminder to return to this great city builder and see how it’s improved since you played it last.",0
"1040","Despite very minor frame rate dips and the occasional glitchy element, the beauty and wonder of Jotun unfolds like a storybook and deserves attention.",1
"1041","Until Dawn is a flawed, but fun experience. Though an unfocused story means it falls short of greatness, it’s an otherwise entertaining homage to the curious traditions of horror movies which pays off your in-game decisions with occasionally shocking consequences.",1
"1042","Rising Tide's great new diplomacy and artifacts can't quite fix Civ: Beyond Earth's replayability problems.",0
"1043","Despite a handful of funny, emotional moments, Escape Plan Bravo is a low point for the Tales series. Its events lack weight, many of the characters are underutilized, and the abrupt ending left me far from satisfied.",0
"1044","Its under-developed single-player and franchise management options leave a lot of points on the field, but they can be safely ignored once you get your bearings as a coach and can join the intense competition online.",1
"1045","An energising shooter experience. Each level, character and enemy brings something fresh to the game, and the end result is chaotic, polished, packed with variety and effortlessly charming.",1
"1046","My time with Siege leaves me feeling like this Rainbow Six revival is a skeleton with not a lot of meat on its bones.",1
"1047","I give Apotheon high praise for its homage to old-school side-scrolling adventures and its ability to recreate the captivating style of Ancient Greek art. Unfortunately, a ho-hum story and frustrating controls prevent me from doing the same for its moment-to-moment gameplay.",0
"1048","Outside of those great few levels, Woolly World is a more forgettable and fragmented experience. Cool mechanics are cooked up, but they’re dropped into levels which never realise their full potential and fixate more on unearthing frustrating collectibles.",0
"1049","When played by yourself or with a friend on the couch, NHL 16 is a fast, sharp-looking, and fun hockey sim that (unlike last year’s game) includes enough modes to keep veterans happy while doing an admirable job of welcoming newcomers as well. It still suffers technical problems with online play.",1
"1050","Rock Band 4 makes smart choices in bringing the series back, even if its setlist is somewhat disappointing.",1
"1051","It’s an endlessly creative and exciting puzzle game that manages to make your failures just as fun and important as your accomplishments.",1
"1052","An experience that generally feels unique and fun.",0
"1053","It’s truly a dizzying amount of Disney; a virtual toy box packed with some of the most beloved characters from the past hundred years of entertainment, polished up and overflowing with fun and options for creativity.",1
"1054","Best of all, Syndicate asks you to take London back in a way puts the last few games to shame.",1
"1055","Expect vagueness, under-explanation, and frustration at the start, but perseverance is rewarded with sci-fi warfare on a scale you'll see in few other shooters.",1
"1056","Tales from the Borderlands Episode 2: Atlas Mugged makes the most out of its short length by packing every scene with hilarious dialogue, emotional reveals, and legitimately tough decisions.",1
"1057","A beautiful, heart-breaking journey into the end of the world.",1
"1058","Dontnod has created great scenarios for a story I’m eager to learn more about, but the moment-to-moment interactions with people in Max Caulfield’s life are pretty painful.",0
"1059","While echoes of the original release pacing problems remain, the Director's Cut does much to add variety to the experience with new features such as perks, quirks, and precision aiming.",1
"1060","The combat that makes up the majority of gameplay is fun but forgettable, and there's little else to keep you engaged unless you're sufficiently attached to the license.",0
"1061","The Elder Scrolls Online: TU's combat handles well on a gamepad, making it a great way to experience all this content.",1
"1062","The ramifications of my actions in Life is Strange: Episode 2 - Out of Time have more than earned my interest in the rest of the season, even if it means enduring the inconsistent character performances and awkward writing.",0
"1063","With the right composition of friends holding controllers, IDARB becomes a ridiculous, intense sports game that is much smarter and more technical than its silly presentation may lead you to believe.",1
"1064","Archetypal characters with weak lines and worse delivery don’t ruin everything, but they make it harder to buy into a story that’s trying so hard to have heart.",0
"1065","A lot is packed into this eventful two-hour episode of Telltale’s Game of Thrones.",1
"1066","Sparse interactivity and a lack of commitment to explaining this world and its inhabitants hold Episode 1 back, but I’m still absorbed in my story, and eager to find out what happens next.",0
"1067","An object lesson for how game compilations should be engineered, providing rock-solid adaptation to a new platform, respecting the material’s historic context, and exercising restraint.",1
"1068","Transformers Devastation’s nostalgia-fueled fisticuffs are a fun way to revisit the classic TV show.",1
"1069","Dragon Age: Inquisition’s tale comes to a close not with a bang, not with a whimper, but with some satisfying closure and challenging combat met with allies that’ve become close friends.",0
"1070","Its progression system stifles it a bit early on, but regardless, Evolve is a deeply rewarding multiplayer experience that packs both brains and brawn.",1
"1071","Grey Goo is likely the best traditional RTS not made by Blizzard in the past five years. The cinematic, exciting presentation of the campaign is a big selling point by itself, even if the mission structure and actual scenarios are less than revolutionary.",1
"1072","Major developments and long-awaited action push Telltale’s Game of Thrones: Episode 4 - Sons of Winter into position as the best episode yet.",1
"1073","Persona 4: Dancing All Night highlights the wonderful music from the Persona series while building a solid story.",1
"1074","Looking at Dishonored today, there are elements of the design that haven’t aged gracefully, such as the tendency for mission design to be compartmentalised and the somewhat quirky controls, but the gameplay is still a liberating experience, as it’s grounded in player choice.",1
"1075","Wolfenstein: The Old Blood places almost all its bets on the intense combat carried over from the game that came before it. The weapons feel great, and the arenas are interesting and filled with opportunity for some strategic creativity. But by doing this, The Old Blood misses out on some of the quieter moments that made The New Order so special. The Old Blood doubles down on blood and guts, but in doing so sacrifices some of its heart.",0
"1076","Dark Room finally sets off the mystery but it’s the least consistent episode of Life Is Strange so far.",0
"1077","It’s one of the most thought-provoking and ultimately disarming interactive experiences I’ve had all year, and one I won’t easily shake off.",1
"1078","The most fun I’ve had with an Assassin’s game since Black Flag. In fact, I liked it more. Apart from its ill-fitting conclusion, it never takes itself too seriously and delights in the rich possibilities of its Victorian setting and great new grapple gun.",1
"1079","As an RPG, Yo-Kai Watch mostly fumbles its battle system and creates a relatively passive experience. However, I adored exploring every corner of its compelling world.",0
"1080","Wolfenstein: The Old Blood places almost all its bets on the intense combat carried over from the game that came before it. The weapons feel great, and the arenas are interesting and filled with opportunity for some strategic creativity.

The Old Blood doubles down on blood and guts, but in doing so sacrifices some of its heart.",0
"1081","The first part of Pillars of Eternity's White March expansion is weak on story and heavy on combat.",0
"1082","There’s certainly no shortage of things to do in Skylanders SuperChargers, and everything you can do is highly polished, however simple it all might be.",1
"1083","Blood Bowl 2 is a smashy, satisfying, irreverent combat-sports melee that leaves just a bit too much of the outcome up to the six-sided dice.",1
"1084","The representation of the music is just so much more alive than it was before – these courses absolutely buzz with life and energy.",1
"1085","Story of Seasons’ kept me occupied for well over 30 hours, and even then I could have kept playing until the cows came home.",1
"1086","It’s rare for a big multiplayer game like Evolve to feel so considered and intelligent.",1
"1087","Sure, the story is dull, and there aren’t a whole lot of original ideas at play here, but the vast expanse of the adventure should please anyone who missed out on it the first time around.",1
"1088","The big problem is that even when it works smoothly, there’s nothing special about Armello beyond its style to elevate it beyond passable.",0
"1089","Wolfenstein: The Old Blood places almost all its bets on the intense combat carried over from the game that came before it.

The Old Blood doubles down on blood and guts, but in doing so sacrifices some of its heart.",0
"1090","The action, humor, and drama are all improved, and Story Mode continues to use Minecraft elements like mob grinders and Endermen to great effect. More improvements need to be made for Story Mode to be considered one of Telltale’s greats, but for now it is moving in the right direction.",1
"1091","While it's not as deep as it first appears, fun and fast naval-style combat and a vast explorable galaxy made me want to try out each of its different styles of captaining, and kept me happily blasting away.",1
"1092","Life is Strange suffers from awful voice acting and writing that doesn’t do its characters and world justice.",0
"1093","Aside from awkward performances and a poor original score, Battlefront is a master class in aesthetic authenticity. Beyond a few essential modes built for casual competition, however, Battlefront is unfocused, relying on excess game types to compensate for an absent single-player campaign.",1
"1094","Hopping through the floaty gravity and feel-good physics of Grow Home is as pleasant a gaming experience as they come.",1
"1095","It does a great job of creating compelling mechanics, so it’s slightly disappointing the bigger design where everything comes together to make really interesting or challenging gameplay fails to materialise. But it absolutely succeeds in creating a tranquil world of weirdness.",0
"1096","Beginning as a furtive, desperate survival-horror experience, Dying Light gradually and gratifyingly evolves into a fast, hyper-violent celebration of vertical freedom and zombie destruction.",1
"1097","Sophisticated combo-based combat delivers a fast and furious barrage of action, but the gear and perks systems left me wondering why they were there at all in a game all about over-the-top boss fights and robot dinosaur beatdowns.",1
"1098","Resident Evil Revelations 2’s pulpy story, occasionally brilliant co-op gameplay, and excellent Raid mode balances out its dull environments and overused enemies.",0
"1099","That it’s so mechanically rich and still conveys the raw energy and fun of duking it out with huge monsters and action-figure-esque hunters is a real design feat.",1
"1100","Despite uninspiring environmental design, stakes are getting higher, enemies are tougher, and co-operative play is more essential. Now that’s more like it.",1
"1101","Titan Souls’ sparse world and lore is merely the delivery device for its creative fights that hinge on your perception and skillful mastery of its simple, yet fluid and responsive controls. Though the experience is short, it’s potent, as weathering every titan’s impossibly lethal storm and finding that one true strike is an excellent and intoxicating retelling of David versus Goliath each time.",1
"1102","Despite not having much to do outside of the campaign new defense missions, exploring the Valley of the Yetis is good fun - both as the hunter and as the hunted.",1
"1103","Just Cause 3 is a playground where you get to be a physics-defying force of destruction, and its loop of liberating dozens of towns across this enormous scenic world would’ve gotten old much quicker if the combat wasn’t so full of options for free-form mayhem. Getting the most out of it requires some creativity and tolerance for performance bugs on your part, so come expecting to make at least some of your own fun.",1
"1104","With elegant simplicity and an eye for charming detail, it got its hooks into me early on, and I embraced the challenge of unraveling the mystery of how its systems worked.",1
"1105","Despite the barbed wire and reinforced walls that Rainbow Six Siege makes you walk through in order to get to the meat of the gameplay, I can’t stop thinking about how much fun that gameplay is.",1
"1106","Daedalic effectively removed the elements that made last year's release annoying at all the wrong moments, and left its players with the best parts of the experience. It's still a methodical, almost plodding tactical roleplaying game, but now it's easier to find the fun and to enjoy its world and characters.",1
"1107","Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number is a great game and a worthy sequel. It’s more confident in its style, storytelling ability, and level design than the first game.",1
"1108","An emotional intro and devastating outro show how well Dontnod can handle both separately, but the hours in between leave so much to be desired in terms of marrying these people to their story.",0
"1109","Episode 4: Metamorphosis does a satisfactory job at tying up Resident Evil Revelations 2’s mysteries, yet it also presents us with the clunkiest gameplay and dialogue we’ve seen in this series. While the bonus episodes and robust Raid mode extend the life of Revelations 2 beyond the credits, I wish it had gone out with a slightly bigger bang.",0
"1110","One Piece’s unique style of fighting also translates quite well to musou combat, but fitting in the story bogs down that combat somewhat. Instead of enjoying both fighting and dialogue, it became a weird kind of chore to play through battles just to progress the story.",0
"1111","Its main story is unspectacular, but the memorable side quests and sheer fun of exploring its world do a fantastic job of offsetting that, making Dying Light one of the most engrossing open-world games – zombie-infested or otherwise – I've played in a while.",1
"1112","High-speed parkour and gruesome zombie massacres make Dying Light a blast, even if the story's just okay.",1
"1113","The potential of powerful, story-altering choices is largely blown on an episode full of out-of-character portrayals and padding scenes that don’t move us any closer to the finish line.",0
"1114","While the story of these likable new characters continues after the shocking events of the premiere, the second episode makes it feel like a false start by neglecting to advance the plot in interesting ways.",0
"1115","Its campaign is both a great shooter and a great stealth game, and its typical plot is spiced with interesting characters and sparse but punctual humor. The large-scale tactical multiplayer combat the series is known for is still as good as it’s ever been, but the speedy new Hotwire and round-based 5v5 modes provide both speed and thrills.",1
"1116","A delightfully charming and unique platformer. Its world is varied, its challenge is high, and the hand-molded look and feel make for a remarkable journey.",1
"1117","There’s plenty of content in both, and I’ll be back for more Mario, at least.",1
"1118","At its best, Just Cause 3's over-the-top action and physics-based mayhem has me laughing out loud on the regular. It’s a damn shame so many performance problems and punishing load times keep cropping up, because I love what Just Cause 3 does. But for game that’s so heavily dependent on action to run this poorly is no laughing matter.",0
"1119","Judgement gallops along at a great pace, and ends once again on a very curious cliffhanger.",1
"1120","The Legend of Zelda: Tri Force Heroes is a fun co-op adventure that's best played with two friends.",1
"1121","Episode 1 is let down by dull environments and creature design, but a terrific co-op mode, intriguing story, and replayable Raid Mode balances out its flaws. Not quite a headshot, then; but it’s left a bloody impression on me nonetheless.",0
"1122","WWE 2K16 takes a big step back towards being the exhaustive suite of wrestling wish-fulfillment it’s expected to be.",1
"1123","Hard West isn’t the deepest game of its kind, but it does a good job of walking the line between cold, hard tactics, and Weird West-style personality.",0
"1124","As much as I enjoyed its aggressive brand of tactical combat and interesting enemy types, there are too many unpredictable variables outside your control, and too much happening to too many quickly aging, mortal characters for this tactical game to feel like decisions matter.",0
"1125","Broken Age: Act 2 wraps up Shay and Vella’s story in great fashion. The jokes are punchy, the twists are rewarding, and most of the puzzles are satisfying in a special way.",1
"1126","Aside from awkward performances and a poor original score, Battlefront is a master class in aesthetic authenticity. Beyond a few essential modes built for casual competition, however, Battlefront is unfocused, relying on excess game types to compensate for an absent single-player campaign.",1
"1127","Refreshingly different.",1
"1128","Dating birds may seem silly, but Hatoful Boyfriend nails its plot with the help of its well-written characters, and even surpasses its humorous premise with mysterious themes and dark undertones.",1
"1129","Type-0’s gritty tone, fast-paced action, and strategic approach to time management is a welcome change of pace from the usual Final Fantasy experience. Though an exasperating camera and clunky mission controls sometimes dampened my fun, I enjoyed meeting the Class Zero cadets and guiding them through battle. There’s definitely no other class quite like them.",1
"1130","Anno 2205 is an engaging and strategic city builder with unique challenges in each of its attractive biomes. But ultimately, it manifests as a never-ending treadmill of trying to supply the picky, luxury-loving consumers of the 23rd century with more techno-garbage.",0
"1131","Lost Dimension is greatly held back by its inability to keep up the pressure of the disappointing betrayal system and its poorly written story. Still, this RPG manages to find its footing with its excellent combat system and interesting character abilities.",0
"1132","It may have linear dungeons and a less-than-stellar story, but it’s open-world exploration, enjoyable customization, and flashy new Armitization feature are enough for it to stand on its own.",1
"1133","Aside from awkward performances and a poor original score, Battlefront is a master class in aesthetic authenticity. Beyond a few essential modes built for casual competition, however, Battlefront is unfocused, relying on excess game types to compensate for an absent single-player campaign.",1
"1134","With more exciting combat, Zombi might have been a must-own for horror fans. As it stands, it’s a fun game that does most things right, but constantly reminds you of its biggest flaw.",1
"1135","Seeing the series' iconic moments recreated with cute figurines is a treat, and each of the four campaigns is fast-paced enough that completing the entire franchise in its brick-based form will only take roughly seven to eight hours, which is not much longer than the combined film running times (and amounts to brisk mini-campaigns of two hours or less each).",1
"1136","State of Decay deservedly shattered Xbox Live Arcade sales records in 2013: it is a potent mix of RPG gameplay systems that all fuse together to create an unpredictable and tense survival experience. Time hasn’t taken anything away from that for Year One Survival Edition, and though it hasn’t fixed its technical problems either, this zombie-bashing, resource-managing post-apocalyptic gem still stands out from the horde of brainless zombie games.",1
"1137","I’ll keep defying gravity as Adrian Neville, and defying expectations as Dolph Ziggler, because WWE 2K16 is as close to a fusion of performance and competition as a wrestling game has ever gotten. That’s what I come to wrestling for, and that’s what 2K16 delivers.",1
"1138","It manages to maintain interest with randomized dungeons that usually work out well, but could really benefit from some balance tweaks and a way to put more fully developed decks to the test.",0
"1139","Type-0’s gritty tone, fast-paced action, and strategic approach to time management is a welcome change of pace from the usual Final Fantasy experience. Though an exasperating camera and clunky mission controls sometimes dampened my fun, I enjoyed meeting the Class Zero cadets and guiding them through battle. There’s definitely no other class quite like them.",1
"1140","Darksiders 2: Deathinitive Edition brings the original’s diverse world, interesting dungeons, and great loot system to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Sure, the story is dull, and there aren’t a whole lot of original ideas at play here, but the vast expanse of the adventure should please anyone who missed out on it the first time around.",1
"1141","Though it momentarily made me want to commit crimes against my controller at certain points when playing alone, Magicka 2’s one-of-a-kind magic system made it difficult to stay mad for very long.",1
"1142","Though it doesn’t always allow you to play it the way it seems to beg to be played, it still manages to be enjoyable overall until the credits roll.",0
"1143","The most astonishing thing about Hardline’s multiplayer is how successful it is in trying to please everyone.",1
"1144","It’s still a little too slow-paced and predictable to recommend wholeheartedly.",0
"1145","It’s mildly disappointing to see the framerate capped, and that bots are still in the same state after all this time, but Payday 2’s deep mechanics and purity of vision still make it one of the best, yet most overlooked multiplayer games you can play today.",1
"1146","When the spectacular fireworks and hilarious, delightfully destructive chaos kick off, the frame rate often drops well below 30 frames per second. And when the frame rate drops, it’s much harder to defy death as you’re piloting one of the many helicopters, jets, or cars, or stay in the air when you’re using the fun but touchy wingsuit. When you die, you’re subjected to loading times that can last 90 seconds or more.",0
"1147","It’s a clever game that’s not afraid to be challenging, and a very enjoyable puzzle if you don’t mind it also being a touch vague, often repetitive, and happy to quickly get as hard as figuring out an actual prison break.",1
"1148","Quirks aside, Legends of Eisenwald is a strong, simple tactical RPG that’s all the better for staying within its means.",0
"1149","The drama might not be as heightened as something like The Walking Dead, but I still found myself surprisingly invested in the choices I had to make about my companions, undeveloped as they may be, and smiling at the Minecrafty in-jokes.",0
"1150","Gauntlet: Slayer Edition streamlines the combat and adds a bit more replay value to last year's release, but there still isn't quite enough meat on this dungeon crawler's bones.",0
"1151","Although career mode suffers from uneven difficulty and some situational camera issues, I happily replayed levels to improve my score sheet and climb the leaderboard, or just endlessly tinker with the Sandbox mode.",1
"1152","The focus on extermination saps excitement and possibilities from the strategic level, and the tactical minigames don’t have the AI needed to make the ship-building system’s depth pay off.",0
"1153","Ronin is an interesting and stylish ninja game based on interesting and original strategy mechanics. The game is flawed by a trial and error difficulty level design and an unforgiving and unrefined checkpoint system.",0
"1154","It’s a shame Dungeons 2’s above-ground RTS battles are so primitive and poor, because the underground dungeon-management stuff actually works fairly well.",0
"1155","Whether you’re a Mario vs. Donkey Kong series veteran or are diving into the toy-puzzle scene for the first time, Tipping Stars will (eventually) challenge you with tough stages to master, even if it doesn’t exactly bring anything new of value to the table.",0
"1156","A quirky game with its heart in the right place and its head in the clouds.",0
"1157","The problem is that sense of inevitability mixes with the lack of resolution for major parts of the plot in an unappealing way.",0
"1158","Code Name STEAM is a strange hybrid of turn-based tactics and action, but its simple mechanics create plenty of head-scratching decisions in single or multiplayer.",1
"1159","Though it may occasionally test your patience, Magicka 2's charm and depth make it a really fun co-op experience.",1
"1160","It’s a conflicting place of despair, a personal playground of explosive action and compulsive, unending progression that I can’t wait to get back to, and one hell of a ride.",1
"1161","Oblitus is a little game with a big heart, and while not all the bosses end up as intimidating as they seem, the inclusion of random enhancements and beautiful, subtly changing environments make every run a unique and perilous adventure worth fighting.",0
"1162","There are many ways in which this Assassin’s Creed could have gone terribly wrong, but didn’t. Its problems lie, instead, in its inability to truly let the player off the leash, and its uncharacteristically soulless presentation.",0
"1163","I like Infinite Crisis, especially Coast City, but I just wish there were an easier way to play more of it.",0
"1164","One nice little surprise that draws on many sources of inspiration, but still manages to stand out for its own virtues.",1
"1165","Chilling ghosts and a malevolent story make the new Fatal Frame an unsettling experience.",0
"1166","There are plenty of fun puzzles in store along with a timer mechanic, but the cramped, dark setting and lack of visual variety tends to rob these elements of the charm they could have.",0
"1167","Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: China is by no means a poorly made game, it’s just an un-exciting one.",0
"1168","It manages to scratch a very old PC gaming itch, at least between the awful cutscenes and performance problems.",0
"1169","While the first half of The Park tends to lean a bit too hard into the horror tropes of a spooky carnival, the final act does a really great job of developing a character with the pathos that comes from being a mother who’s having a tough time dealing with the impossible stress that comes from being a parent. Sure, it’s some of the same ground that Silent Hill games have covered in the past, but that doesn’t diminish its effectiveness.",0
"1170","Rise of Incarnates' great fighting action depends heavily on teamwork - when you bring a friend, it shines.",1
"1171","Customizing my own character’s equipment and move pool is fantastic...but it’s hard to get excited when combat feels hollow, especially for a franchise all about heroes stronger than Superman.",0
"1172","It's supported by a few memorably silly cutscenes, but Gat Out of Hell isn't as story-rich or even as funny as previous Saints Row expansions, and so it ends up feeling like a missed opportunity, settling for a shallow diversion when it could have put a grand coda on Saints Row IV's story.",0
"1173","Happy Home Designer gets pretty much everything right when it comes to decorating, encouraging creativity, and exploring different styles.",1
"1174","Neverwinter's gamepad-friendly combat and intuitive interface make it the best fantasy MMORPG I’ve played on a console yet.",0
"1175","Taken slowly, Sunset is a beautiful, fascinating experience.",1
"1176","In my experience, two types of people get the most enjoyment out of Mario Party: Small children and inebriated adults. Nintendo's intended audience in Mario Party 10, as with its predecessors, is clearly kids (they will probably love the amiibo tapping).",0
"1177","Need for Speed looks the part, sounds the part, and is surprisingly reverent to real-world car culture. I like the direction Ghost has taken here, and I think it’s the right one, but beneath its flashy exterior it's not quite firing on all cylinders.",0
"1178","Halo: Spartan Strike's upgraded parts aren't immediately apparent, but the sum total is pretty striking. A pinch of better aiming here, a heaping helping of Promethian enemies there, and annoying microtransactions nowhere make Spartan Strike worth the quick and cheap sub-ten-dollar tour.",0
"1179","Saints Row IV is just as much silly, largely challenge-free fun in Re-Elected as it was originally, even if it doesn't look as impressive as other recent remasters.",1
"1180","It charmed me with its blend of old-school RPG and contemporary satire, but nearly lost my vote with its sluggish pacing, irritatingly high enemy encounter rate, and crashes.",0
"1181","Though it doesn’t exactly put the added power of the PS4 and Xbox One to full use, Payday 2: Crimewave Edition is the best-looking console version of Payday 2 you can get, and the best value on any platform for obtaining its wealth of downloadable content.",1
"1182","A pleasant surprise in a crowded platforming field. The obstacles present--portals, bounce pads, zip ramps--have all been seen before, but their implementation is anything but stale.",1
"1183","Interestingly, Gat Out of Hell doesn't really feature traditional story missions. Instead, it tasks you with completing handfuls of side activities for its condemned supporting characters, and triggers cutscenes once you've finished a certain number of them. It's an odd, somewhat repetitive approach, although making side tasks key to story progression does make them feel a lot more worthwhile.",1
"1184","With few features, annoying AI, and broken multiplayer, it's hard to appreciate F1 2015's improved driving.",0
"1185","The new weapons, including a minigun-equipped armchair and the Ark of the Covenant – which uses enemies as ammo – are a blast for mowing down guardian demons.",1
"1186","Despite a lackluster story and some unnecessary new obstacles, its large playable area and unique underground locations give you lots of opportunities to use its explosive new weaponry, hone your stealth or combat skills or simply experience more of what you enjoyed about Unity’s original release.",1
"1187","Sid Meier’s Starships’ battles held my attention for a handful of games, after which point the tactical AI’s behavior became exploitable and the strategic layer became too muddled and unpredictable.",0
"1188","Its best aspects are its stunning looks, atmosphere, and style – which are truly fantastic – and entertaining fiction. But the shallow, slow, and generic quick-time event-riddled gameplay make it feel like an experience that would've been better served by a non-interactive movie than a game.",0
"1189","Despite some good ideas and cool design choices, Whispering Willows can't deliver a wholly fulfilling experience.",0
"1190","The single-player campaign is paper thin, combat and enemies are repetitive, and the fan service kept to a minimum. On the other hand, adding other players to the mix lets you find the fun in its smooth controls, coordinating attacks against hordes of enemies, and tough competitive duels.",0
"1191","Batgirl: A Matter of Family has a decent story, an impressive setting, and some respectable brawls and Predator fights, but it’s all so disappointingly brief and self-contained.",0
"1192","A lean tie-in that at least provides some great-looking new cars, a boost of nitrous, and a short but appropriately themed set of races. It’s fun while it lasts, but it’s also proved to be disappointingly built around recycled maps and events.",0
"1193","Concessions are often made when sports games straddle the gap between console generations old and new, but considering the two year wait for a game that is only being released on current gen hardware (and PC), the rampant slash and burn of its feature set is particularly galling.",0
"1194","A competent but completely uninspired physics puzzle game that owes much to its predecessors but never really builds on the concept with ideas of its own.",0
"1195","The frantic button prompts, still-stupid stealth, and newly-introduced glitches make this Remaster way too unrefined.",0
"1196","Despite a great cast of characters, J-Stars Victory Vs.+ fails to leverage their charm on or off the battlefield.",0
"1197","The bones of a decent procedural horror game are buried under roughly six feet of frustrating fixed camera angles, insta-death, and bad checkpointing. Ultimately, it’s just not that much fun being a detective in the dark.",0
"1198","The great tragedy of Sword Coast Legends is that the last couple of years have all but paved the way for it to emerge as the best of the cRPG renaissance, but its dull cooldown-based combat, linear quests, and cookie-cutter user-made content ensure that it's likely to be among the first to be forgotten.",0
"1199","Its clumsy controls make it disheartening at first, but it's worth it for the reward of eventually overcoming them and finding destructive new paths to toasty success.",0
"1200","Beyond Eyes has a fascinating premise and a lot of potential, but its bare-bones plot just isn’t up to the task.",0
"1201","EA Tiburon has managed to create a golf game with plenty of holes in it; just not the kind that fans will relish.",0
"1202","NBA Live 16 can only go so far with clumsy controls holding it back.",0
"1203","I badly wanted Beyond Eyes to use its attractively whitewashed look and novel, visually limited ideas to tell a much more moving story whose empathetic lessons could’ve stayed with me long after the end credits rolled, but it didn’t.",0
"1204","It’s lack of accessible controls or incentive for laboring through arduous stages, combined with the sloppy presentation of its story suggests that Aaru woke up a little prematurely.",0
"1205","NBA Live 16 can only go so far with clumsy controls holding it back.",0
"1206","Snappier writing and delivery might’ve made this premise work better, however not even some entertaining puzzles and wisecracks from Melvin can make this superhero adventure fly.",0
"1207","Submerged attempts to replace tension with curiosity as a motivating force, and largely succeeds even though its environmental storytelling isn’t as dense as it could’ve been.",0
"1208","In the moments where Submerged rewarded inquisitiveness, I loved it. When it occasionally stumbled in that responsibility, I found myself wishing for a more polished and complete world to explore.",0
"1209","The amiibo integration is cumbersome and hard to play with, and interesting ideas like the use of the stalk market are limited by a slow pace. It’s delightful enough to make me smile, but it’s still a bit boring.",0
"1210","A remarkable achievement in blockbuster storytelling and graphical beauty. Though it’s let down by a lack of imagination and some self-indulgence, especially in a third act that drags on far too long, Uncharted 4 carries on the series’ proud tradition of peerless polish and style, with a great multiplayer component to boot. Most importantly, it’s a gentle sendoff to the rag-tag group of characters we’ve known for nine years.",1
"1211","Inside very clearly builds upon what made Limbo great, and in fact builds something greater. Its unimaginable twist may leave you dumbfounded, confused, and quite possibly speechless, but it will fuel heated discussion with your friends about its meaning, its message, and its intentions.",1
"1212","Blood and Wine ends the saga of Geralt of Rivia in style, bringing with it a tale of charming vampires and troublesome friendship set in a stunning new landscape that departs from the bleakness we've known until now. The expansion also brings some welcome gameplay enhancements, including mutations, the ability to dye armor, and a vineyard for growing herbs. Most of all, it leaves Geralt in a good place.",1
"1213","Overwatch is an incredible achievement in multiplayer shooter design. It bobs and weaves almost perfectly between being the quick-fix adrenaline hit you might want after a long day of work, and the thoughtful, strategic multiplayer experience that becomes the center of evening-long binges with friends. It might not have the most exhaustive list of maps and modes, but it provides nearly endless opportunities for exhilarating, coordinated play. When you’re at the center of it, it feels like nothing else.",1
"1214","While it didn't exactly drown me in options, maps, and modes, it’s blessed with a multitude of tactical layers, and none of them ever came between me and my enjoyment of its intense, swirling teamfights, and thrilling overtime comebacks.",1
"1215","Forza Horizon 3 is a masterclass in open-world racing and bigger and better than its excellent predecessor across the board. It looks fantastic, the car selection and customisation is second to none, and the size and variety of the sprawling Australian outback is magnificent. Above all, Horizon 3 never loses sight of the fact that tearing through postcard-perfect locations should be fun, and it puts the tools in our hands to keep it that way, always. This is the racing game I’ve been waiting for, and it's officially my favourite thing on four wheels. A fair dinkum triumph, mates.",1
"1216","Inside very clearly builds upon what made Limbo great, and in fact builds something greater.

"1218","Route Zero: Act 4 constantly alternates between serene and unsettling, with the occasional dash of humor thrown in.",1
"1219","If Dark Souls 3 truly is the last in the series as we know it, then it’s a worthy send-off. Weapon arts allow stylish and versatile new moves without tarnishing the purity of the combat system. Lothric’s awe-inspiring locations provide visually stunning arenas for rigorous exploration and fierce face-offs with hosts of deadly enemies and even deadlier bosses. While not all the risky changes land as neatly as others, Dark Souls 3 is a powerful journey and the sequel the series truly deserves.",1
"1220","Even if you don’t have a PSVR, Rez Infinite is still the most complete version of an imaginative cult classic with deceptively nuanced gameplay, but if you do, it’s also an impressive glimpse into the transportive power of virtual reality.",1
"1221","It’s rare that a sequel evolves on every part of the original concept so consistently for the better, but Titanfall 2 is that exception. Its feelgood movement is the foundation for both the engaging action and platforming gameplay of its strong campaign and its over-the-top competitive multiplayer. With bolstered progression, customization, variety, and a fleshed-out story, Respawn has made good on its original vision with Titanfall 2. And bottom line, it’s just damn fun to play.",1
"1222","If Dark Souls 3 truly is the last in the series as we know it, then it’s a worthy send-off.

"1223","Unfortunately, Xbox One version does suffer from some slight stuttering in larger areas like the farm, but developer Chucklefish confirms that there is a planned update to fix it within the coming weeks. Otherwise, Stardew Valley for consoles is still the same great game we first played on PC, and comes just as highly recommended.",1
"1224","While maps are not its strong point, Battlefield 1’s dynamically destructible environments and the minutely balanced mechanics of its classes and gadgets keep the moment-to-moment first-person shooting varied and engaging.",1
"1225","With so many interconnected systems, from the farm simulation to simple combat and cooking to crafting, and each driving the others forward in some way, it’s a deeper and more complex game than you’d expect after the first day on the farm. There’s plenty to do while I wait to uncover more of the Valley’s secrets, and the prospect of filling my days with new adventures or just a better harvest is too enticing to pass up.",1
"1226","For PS4 players just getting their first opportunity to play Rise of the Tomb Raider, 20 Year Celebration is a complete and amazing package.",1
"1227","NBA 2K17 is another rock-solid game in the franchise. It features worthwhile updates to the dribbling and shooting mechanics, and backs up those improvements off the court in ways that make me care about managing my team.",1
"1228","It comes together brilliantly. Thanks to a new spin on the same great tactical combat, plus unpredictable maps and randomized objectives and loot, XCOM 2 is an amazing game I’ll easily put hundreds of hours into.",1
"1229","With two unique sets of skills to play with across 10 themed chapters that keep things interesting and a gorgeous, evocative world that feels alive, Dishonored 2 is a remarkable experience.",1
"1230","Fire Emblem: Revelation is an excellent final act to the Fates storyline. Its balance of difficulty and accessibility means that both veteran players and newcomers can enjoy it without feeling bored or overwhelmed, and its story starts slowly, but quickly becomes a worthy finale to this tactical trilogy.",1
"1231","Civilization VI will go down in history as the most fully-featured launch version in the series. Many of those are smartly revamped versions of Civ classics, buy it finds its own identity with great new ideas like spread-out cities, customizeable governments, research boosts, and leader agendas.

"1233","After months of missteps, Legion shows World of Warcraft finding its footing again and asserting its relevance after more than a decade. Many elements make this an expansion worth enjoying, including class halls, gigantic zones filled with memorable stories, better socialization, the actiony new Demon Hunter class, and world quests.",1
"1234","Owlboy shines thanks to surprisingly varied, Metroidvania-style gameplay and a charming cast of unlikely heroes whose bittersweet journey is among the best I’ve experienced in recent years. Its remarkably detailed pixel art makes every scene more breathtaking than the last, but it’s the relationships between characters in both story and gameplay that makes Owlboy something truly special.",1
"1235","For the most part, its themes weave themselves beautifully throughout the gorgeous world and wide variety of puzzles, but even when it breaks subtlety in favor of a more heavy-handed approach to exposition, it never detracts from the truly fulfilling moments The Witness offers in terms of solving its physical puzzles and unlocking its deepest mysteries.",1

"1237","After 20 years of slow but steady evolution, Pokemon gets a bit of a reinvention in Sun and Moon. An engrossing and rich new region makes the Alola journey — along with all the changes Sun and Moon make to the existing formula — enjoyable throughout the main adventure, and small interface and variety of upgrades along the way make a few of the things that stayed the same feel better than before.",1

"1239","The Witness is a game brimming with secrets: daunting and multilayered mysteries that sunk into my subconscious, tracing snaking paths across my brain until I was literally seeing mazes every time I closed my eyes. That’s the kind of power The Witness has. It hooked me in with its masterful puzzle design and gorgeous visuals, then compelled me forward as I began to carve out my own purpose on the island. It’s a freedom granted by a world as welcomingly open to exploration as it is enjoyably challenging to crack open.",1
"1240","The intense difficulty is squarely aimed at veteran Fire Emblem players, and its satisfying campaign is full of variety and challenge. And even though a win or loss can down to sheer luck, I walked away either satisfied or eager to give it another shot.",1

"1242","With smarter AI opposition and an altogether smoother online experience, PES 2017 is close to the complete package. FIFA’s new story mode might be the most headline-grabbing feature of either game this year, but it’s clear Konami is in no mood to relinquish its title as king of the virtual pitch.",1
"1243","With bolstered progression, customization, variety, and a fleshed-out story, Respawn has made good on its original vision with Titanfall 2. And bottom line, it’s just damn fun to play.",1
"1244","I feel like I’ve touched upon everything I love about Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir, and yet I still can’t seem to say enough good things about this amazing remake.",1
"1245","Boasting an absolutely gorgeous environment, terrific snow effects, and just about everything else that’s made Forza Horizon 3 the best racing game this generation, Blizzard Mountain should be a compulsory stopover for anyone looking to expand the Forza Horizon 3 experience, or seeking a good reason to dive back in.",1
"1246","It’s a short ride, but one I felt compelled to take again – including a search for its mysterious hidden orb collectibles. Play it soon before anyone spoils a single big moment for you.",1
"1247","The Witness has a power and pull that carried me throughout the more than 40 hours it took to complete it for the first time, and that, even now, beckons me back to confront the mysteries I left unsolved. Its graceful combination of tangible goals, obscurity, and freedom creates ample opportunity for small victories and grand revelations alike.",1
"1248","Stardew Valley's transition to consoles is a smooth one. Both the PS4 and Xbox One versions include the great post-launch updates we've seen in the PC version, like the new farm templates, divorce, bug fixes, and more romance options. The controller mapping is taken from the PC version, so they're familiar, but the mouse cursor that's used to navigate menus is a little on the slow side. Still, most of my time was spent farming, talking with neighbors, or in dungeons, so this wasn't a deterrent for me when playing these versions.",1
"1249","Total War: Warhammer brims with exciting ideas, awesome characters, and delightful units and faction mechanics.",1
"1250","An experience you’ll walk away from with a big smile on your face – in campaign, Versus, and Horde modes alike. It’s about as good of a franchise reawakening as I could’ve hoped for.",1
"1251","Though I would have liked a little bit more originality in its central story, which again revolves around a usurper to the throne, it’s the stories that I’ve created on my own using its many creativity-enabling powers that I’ll remember, every graceful, fumbling, and hilarious one of them. I’m compelled to create many more in the months to come.",1
"1252","F1 2016 is definitively the best Formula One game Codemasters has ever crafted.",1
"1253","I greatly enjoyed the two or so hours it took me to play through Pony Island. This is a game that delights in toying with your expectations and in breaking the fourth wall, in revealing its sinister yet playful world, and in building up a compelling antagonist and telling an ambiguous story. Pony Island is about as punk rock as they come.",1
"1254","It’s rare that a sequel evolves on every part of the original concept so consistently for the better, but Titanfall 2 is that exception.",1
"1255","Day of the Tentacle Remastered is a witty, funny, beautiful collection of brain teasers.",1
"1256","Fire Emblem Fates: Birthright is a fantastic balance of tactical challenge and accessibility. Even after I finished the story, I found myself returning to the battlefield again and again to unlock more conversations between friends and test my army’s might against Nohr’s finest. I’m addicted to Fire Emblem Fates, and that’s fine by me.",1

"1258","Hits the core tenants of what makes this series great. Great gear drives the lust for the hunt even on the small scale, but the big, spectacular fights ultimately matter the most. Generations’ tweaked combat adds just the right tools to make slaying epic boss monsters a fun activity that’s just as fun online or off.",1
"1259","It is among the very best of the first-person narrative genre, and it reminds us what video game storytelling is capable of in the right hands. It’s a game I can see coming back to every year or two just to revisit its beautiful sights and memorable characters – just like a good book.",1
"1260","Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun’s uncommon attentiveness to characters and story elevate what is already a really entertaining and mentally stimulating quest across 17th-Century Japan. The near-constant annoyance of the camera definitely hindered my feeling of being a zen ninja assassin. Overall though, developer Mimimi has put together one of the most punishing and clever top-down stealth games I’ve ever skulked through.",1
"1261","Superhot VR’s fantastically clever time-manipulating concept empowers you with the superhuman reflexes of a slow-motion action hero. Shattering waves of glass-like enemies while moving your face out of the path of incoming bullets is a thrilling challenge in both the cryptic story mode and the endless mode that follows.",1
"1262","With smarter AI opposition and an altogether smoother online experience, PES 2017 is close to the complete package.

"1263","Deep and nuanced, stuffed with fan service, and as demanding as you’d like it to be, this is worthy fare for the motorsport obsessed while remaining accessible for the merely curious, and absolutely worth the upgrade from previous years.",1
"1264","Thumper’s brutal, breakneck speed and precision-based musical action kept me entranced for all nine of its bizarre, nightmarish stages, which contained enough nuanced high score-chasing tricks to demand several replays already.",1
"1265","It takes the characters that we fell in love with long ago, and sets them off on their most gorgeous quest yet. The deep and rewarding weapon system, beautiful and varied worlds, and charming-as-heck story make it an adventure that anyone with a PlayStation 4 should strap in for.",1
"1266","Simply put, MLB The Show 16 is the best baseball game available on any current-gen console. It looks, plays, and feels amazing, offering many ways to play the great American pastime. Franchise and Road to the Show modes have made incremental but impressive improvements, while Diamond Dynasty offers entirely new ways to play. Not every mode works, but it’s encouraging to see such a radical new mix of gameplay.",1
"1267","For my money, PES is still ahead where it counts most, but The Journey gives FIFA something unique and rewarding. If you can afford it, this year it might just be worth getting both.",1
"1268","Doom is a tale of two very different shooters (and one quirky creation tool). The single-player campaign's reverent worship of the series' roots results in an old-school run-and-gun shooter which feels like imitation Doom, a cover of an old hit which nails all the right power chords but isn't exactly transformative. The multiplayer's attempts to borrow from the new to reinvigorate the old results in an experience which won't satisfy either school of thought. SnapMap, meanwhile, is a blend of weird and simple and endearing.",0
"1269","Ultimately, Valkyria Chronicles Remastered is a beautifully crafted and original tactical RPG. While this particular package is lacking in special features, it’s still a perfect opportunity to play a charming cult classic at a budget price.",1
"1270","While it may not be an amazing capitalism simulator, Planet Coaster is a fantastic theme park-building sandbox that rarely ever took an idea I had and told me, “No, you can’t do that.",1
"1271","For all that FIFA promises something for every football fan, from the casual observer to the full-kit fanatic, I still find myself wishing that EA Sports would spend a little more time focusing on the basics. You could probably create the perfect football game by letting Konami handle everything on the pitch, with EA Sports responsible for everything off it. But FIFA plays well enough that the gains elsewhere – in terms of licensing, authenticity, and big-match atmosphere – more than compensate for those shortcomings.",1
"1272","If you intend to play one of these fascinating and fun adventures for the first time or the tenth, the BioShock Collection is the best way to go about it.",1
"1273","You could call Salt and Sanctuary a 2D mashup of Dark Souls and Castlevania, and you'd be right. But such a simple pronouncement would be a disservice to the tremendous amount of thought that's gone into Salt and Sanctuary, whether it's in the graphic style that evokes horror through the style of comic strips or in the intricate web of dungeons and castles serves as it map.",1
"1274","I never expected to compare Gears of War 4 to The Force Awakens, but I couldn’t be happier to do so. Like the latest chapter in the story from a time long ago in a galaxy far, far away, Gears of War 4 is directed by a new generation of creators, shares a lot of similar narrative structures to the beloved first piece of the trilogy it succeeds, and is an experience you’ll walk away from with a big smile on your face.",1
"1275","Darkest Dungeon is a punishing and awesome game of tactics, management, and pushing your luck to the breaking point.",1
"1276","Its impeccably designed environments are flush with possibility, remaining completely coherent while supporting a wide variety of routes and character builds, and Jensen’s prodigious new feats of techno-wizardry make add new dimension to both combat and exploration. Mankind Divided never stopped challenging me or rewarding my curiosity, which pushed me to thoroughly explore its beautiful, ruined world while carefully weighing my decisions along the way.",1
"1277","Thumper’s brutal, breakneck speed and precision-based musical action kept me entranced for all nine of its bizarre, nightmarish stages, which contained enough nuanced high score-chasing tricks to demand several replays already.",1
"1278","Hyper Light Drifter is a gorgeous, fast, fluid trek in a neon apocalypse that's hindered by its wordless storytelling.",1
"1279","Enter the Gungeon's roguelike elements and vast array of crazy weapons keep it entertaining for the long haul.",1
"1280","Pleasingly, the menus aren’t troubled with the same frustrating lag that plagued the interface at the launch of the debut episode, and the often horrifically long loading times from Paris have been trimmed.",1
"1281","A Kinect game released in 2016 that's actually worth digging out your Kinect for.",1
"1282","Hitman Episode 2: Sapienza is a fantastic follow-up to the promising first episode; huge, bursting with deadly promise, and begging for many, many playthroughs.",1
"1283","As a veteran returning to play through the three games of BioShock: The Collection is a pleasure, but it’s a bit disappointing to watch the updates and behind-the-scenes content to each entry gradually decline. The original BioShock receives the greatest overhaul and flourishes with new textures and lighting that bring it almost up to modern standards, and a Ken Levine retrospective, while BioShock Infinite is essentially the PC version.",1
"1284","Grim Dawn is one of the best action-RPGs out there, combining excellent hack and slash action with a world and progression curve that makes it worth fighting through. Alone or with friends, it’s hour after hour of top quality combat and looting, with the promise of many more excellent dark times to come.",1
"1285","Darkest Dungeon is a grim and merciless tactical strategy game whose great tension comes from its many layers of complexity, unpredictable randomization, and willingness to put our fragile characters in mortal danger if we dare to venture into its depths in search of treasure and glory. Brilliant narration and stiff yet surprisingly expressive animation make it easy to be drawn into its vague but tantalizing world, though the end feels artificially out of reach.",1
"1286","Its impeccably designed environments are flush with possibility, remaining completely coherent while supporting a wide variety of routes and character builds, and Jensen’s prodigious new feats of techno-wizardry make add new dimension to both combat and exploration. Mankind Divided never stopped challenging me or rewarding my curiosity, which pushed me to thoroughly explore its beautiful, ruined world while carefully weighing my decisions along the way.",1
"1287","It’s a brutal, but brilliant shooter that finds strength in its minimalism, stretching a few seconds of action here and there into endless hours of dreadful fun.",1
"1288","Multiplayer also benefits from the graphics upgrade, and its refreshingly old-school pace is fun and explosive in its own right. It might not have the same effect it did the first time around, but it works as both a great embodiment of what shooters used to be and one that still plays well.",1
"1289","Dragon Quest Builders is totally, thoroughly engaging. Its gameplay is accessible to kids while its dialogue offers enough sly references to keep Dad or Mom amused.",1
"1290","Aside from the smaller-feeling plot, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided improves upon its excellent predecessor in every other way.",1
"1291","This final chapter brings the beloved Zero Escape trilogy to a gratifying end, featuring beautiful character moments, elaborate puzzles, and a mind-bending plot. Not many games will keep me glued to the screen like Zero Time Dilemma did.",1
"1292","Hearts of Iron 4 wields complexity like a swift armor division during the blitzkrieg, allowing it to serve the idea of layered, cerebral, strategic warfare instead of letting it needlessly bog down the experience.",1
"1293","Watch Dogs 2’s distinctive hacking and puzzle mechanics do a great job of reminding you that you’re not playing just another Grand Theft Auto clone as you tear through it’s beautiful Bay Area map. Marcus is a bit too friendly of a guy to be believable as our instrument of mayhem, but the flexible missions let you get through mostly non-violently if you’re good enough at stealth. And when it works, multiplayer is good unconventional cat-and-mouse fun, too.",1
"1294","The Banner Saga 2 is as beautiful and tactical as the first, but with greater variety in combat and story.",1
"1295","Superhot has unique and addictive time-bending puzzles, but it lacks variety and is and very cheesy.",1
"1296","The community’s gameplay wishes were granted with a new focus on Franchise mode, led by the Play the Moments feature. Outside of its mood-killing commentators, Madden 17 is just about everything we’ve been waiting for since EA Sports took full control of the NFL license. Football is back, and it’s only a yard or two short of becoming an all-time great.",1
"1297","F1 2016 is definitively the best Formula One game Codemasters has ever crafted.",1
"1298","There's also some appeal here if you've played before and want to relive Skyrim with the current generation systems, but you'll be best served by picking up the Xbox One version over the PS4 because of superior mod support. However, there’s no new content on the disc to entice you back if you’ve already played all the DLC, only a new coat of paint.",1
"1299","The divide between the highs and lows of The Last Guardian is staggering. For every wonderful moment of absolute beauty and emotional attachment to its lifelike companion, there’s an equal and opposite baffling moment that ruins the mood with frustrating controls and camera angles. But I found myself willing to put up with all of these hiccups if it meant experiencing any of its multitude of incredibly-beautiful moments.",0
"1300","Enter the Gungeon's roguelike elements and vast array of crazy weapons keep it entertaining for the long haul.",1
"1301","Severed starts as a fun take on touch combat, but ends as a tiring journey that neglects its cooler features.",0
"1302","Starbound excels as a crafting and exploration game, as a 2D platformer with varied and engaging combat, and as a Zelda-esque story RPG with a detailed world and memorable alien cultures to interact with. The sheer volume of different kinds of locations to discover, items to craft and build great structures with, and flashy ways to vanquish aliens prevent any part of the experience from getting boring quickly.",1
"1303","If you’ve never experienced Skyrim, the Special Edition is certainly an adventure you can’t afford to miss. It still includes many of the original version’s bugs, ugly character models, and weak combat animations, but the memorable world benefits hugely from improved lighting and effects.",1
"1304","Quadrilateral Cowboy’s puzzles are mostly a joy to play. Its command line hacking is surprisingly accessible and pleasingly tactile, and when combined with its many interesting gadgets it allows for plenty of creative problem-solving and freedom in tackling all manner of whimsical cybercrime.",1
"1305","Plants vs Zombies Garden Warfare 2 is a great online shooter with an unexpected wealth of single-player stuff, too.",1
"1306","Planet Robobot may not be the most challenging platformer around, but its clever use of robotic destruction combined with gorgeous environmental puzzles and unique bosses make for an entertaining ride. I only wish Kirby’s monstrous mech suit could make proper use of the huge amount of collectibles.",1
"1307","The map itself is very good, the atmosphere is excellent, and the hits are challenging. Tricky and more than a little James Bond-esque (the snowed-in private clinic has a real SPECTRE / On Her Majesty’s Secret Service vibe to it), Hokkaido is vintage Hitman at its most creative.",1
"1308","I don’t have a clear sense of where the season as a whole aims to go just yet, but “Ties That Bind Part I” is one of Telltale’s strongest openers in recent memory.",1
"1309","It is among the very best of the first-person narrative genre, and it reminds us what video game storytelling is capable of in the right hands. It’s a game I can see coming back to every year or two just to revisit its beautiful sights and memorable characters – just like a good book.",1
"1310","You could likely beat Shantae: Half-Genie Hero in a couple of sittings, but the platforming action is so varied, and the levels so explorable, it’s worth playing well beyond that. While it's neither innovative nor high-concept, its hand-drawn look and toe-tapping music successfully channel a joy and enthusiasm that has become far too rare in modern video games.",1
"1311","Watch Dogs 2’s distinctive hacking and puzzle mechanics do a great job of reminding you that you’re not playing just another Grand Theft Auto clone as you tear through it’s beautiful Bay Area map. Marcus is a bit too friendly of a guy to be believable as our instrument of mayhem, but the flexible missions let you get through mostly non-violently if you’re good enough at stealth. And when it works, multiplayer is good unconventional cat-and-mouse fun, too.",1
"1312","There is so much good here, so much heart - especially in the relationships between Noctis and his sworn brothers. It just comes with some changes and compromises that were, at times, difficult for this long-time Final Fantasy fan to come to grips with.",1
"1313","A good combat system and gorgeous visuals are significantly let down by an underwhelming and perfunctory narrative that can make progression a real chore. Whilst there are elements that work in isolation, Bravely Second doesn't manage to tie them together in a way that matches the quality of the original.",0
"1314","There’s enough snappy dialogue and silliness in Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice to satisfy long-term series fans, and the conventional courtroom sequences still feel rewarding when you get on a roll and a witness starts to unravel. But the heavy-handed mysticism of its bloated middle act and the general lack of innovation makes for a less than essential entry in the Phoenix Wright saga on the whole.",0
"1315","My time with Zero Time Dilemma was one of great pleasure and anguish, mainly because I knew I was saying goodbye to one of my favorite series.",1
"1316","Despite the much-needed visual overhaul, if you spent 100+ hours with the PlayStation original there’s maybe not quite enough in this 3DS update to tempt you back. But if Dragon Quest VII doesn’t always justify the significant length of its journey, anyone looking for some good story content to last them well into the winter months will find a portable RPG that dwarfs most of its console counterparts.",1
"1317","Under its attractively bright and cartoony art style, Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2 has a great amount of modes and customization options to enjoy, whether alone against the AI or with online allies and enemies.",1
"1318","Tyranny is a memorable RPG that looks great and feels fresh, even while largely working in the confines of the old Infinity Engine style. It's also the rare sprawling RPG that invites you to replay it, as its comparatively short running time and significant changes based on choice greatly change the experience from playthrough to playthrough, and combat is deep enough to last. With Tyranny, the old feels new again.",1
"1319","There are a few times when this puzzle-platformer leans too heavily into classic run-and-jump territory it’s not suited for, but when it stays the course, BoxBoxBoy! is a great example of how to do a lot with only a little.",1
"1320","It’s like walking through a stunning painting, listening to the idle chatter and revealing talks of (sometimes unnatural-sounding) teenagers.",1
"1321","It lacks the depth of the two series it combines, but Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE has strong combat and great style.",1
"1322","Especially with a little more context for the New Frontier revealed, Telltale is starting to better lay out all the logs it has to build a cabin. I just hope the rest of the structure is as strong as the foundation.",1
"1323","Both in combat and out, there are some clearly good ideas, especially the tense and dangerous Dark Zone. But they’re not spread evenly or interwoven cleanly enough to form a cohesive, consistently enjoyable loop.",0
"1324","Despite some inconsequential decision-making and visual roughness, the amount of heart, character, and unflinching honesty in 1979 Revolution’s short two-hour tale is impressive. As an Iranian-American myself, it’s incredibly refreshing to not only see this subject matter explored, but done so in a smart and sensitive way that succeeds in educating as much as entertaining.",1
"1325","Ultimately, The Division’s overly busy, conflicted design philosophies drown its best ingredients in a bland slurry that never quite comes together into a cohesive dish.",0
"1326","Far Harbor adds a large amount of great quests and content within its gloomy but distinctive island setting. Thanks to some well-written, morally ambiguous characters, its choices are as gray as the weather, and much more interesting. Though the new companion isn’t the strongest and the supposedly ruinous radioactive fog is more annoying than threatening, all of the adventuring and new gear absolutely made it worth my while to return to Fallout 4 for Far Harbor.",1
"1327","Dying Light: The Following manages to include a new fun-filled environment to explore along with a vehicle to do so that mesh together well with a story that’s slow to start but ends with a powerful punch.",1
"1328","Next to every good thing The Division does, there hangs a big, ugly asterisk. That same open world is barren and unengaging, combat gets bogged down with samey waves of walking bullet sponges, and character progression is awkwardly fractured in inconvenient ways.",0
"1329","Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm's strong combat is countered hard by poor AI and connection problems.",0
"1330","Hitman Episode 2: Sapienza is a fantastic follow-up to the promising first episode; huge, bursting with deadly promise, and begging for many, many playthroughs.",1
"1331","Although short, Pillars of Eternity: The White March: Part 2 is far more entertaining than the expansion's first half.",1
"1332","Dated graphics and dodgy netcode slow King of Fighters XIV down a bit, but it's still a deep, rewarding fighter.",1
"1333","Housemarque’s previous games have always kept me coming back through the strength of their gameplay alone. Alienation adds a straightforward, but enjoyable power chase on top, making its finely tuned arcade action all the more alluring. Its action-RPG elements won’t make it a replacement for something like Diablo 3 or Grim Dawn, but they successfully provide a structure for unending, enjoyable alien slaughter.",1
"1334","Put simply, I love Deserts of Kharak. It succeeds where so many RTS games fail, giving a multitasking commander all of the information, unit options, and control flexibility needed to remove needless barriers between what your brain wants your army to do, and what it’s actually able to execute at a moment’s notice.",1
"1335","EA Sports' UFC 2 has some technical skill, but is missing the heart of the sport.",0
"1336","Wang's stupid wisecracks kept me smiling from start to finish, and the variety of melee and ranged combat and the loot that dropped from it was satisfying enough that I came back with friends for more. It's great fun in solo or in co-op, and its small degree of randomization is enough to keep the action fresh for at least a few runs.",1
"1337","Most importantly, the hockey presented on the ice is dynamic and fluid, and it serves up an excellent version of the fastest game around.",1
"1338","Stellaris’ great ideas for space strategy are mostly undone by a static, dull mid-game.",0
"1339","The most gaming fun I’ve had with either series in years. The story is great, the levels are dense with fun puzzles, and unlocking all of the secrets is a blast.",1
"1340","As a puzzler it has charm due to Yarny’s engaging skills, but as a platforming experience it’s less remarkable. But to judge it solely on these mechanical aspects would be to overlook its greater achievement: the way it provokes subtle and complex emotions through the use of nature and nostalgia. It all makes for a sincere, warm-hearted, and extremely likeable adventure.",1
"1341","Although not every part of That Dragon, Cancer works, it’s a crushingly intimate game that left me thankful for the people who are still in my life, and reflective on those who are not. I’m so grateful to the Greens for sharing their experience.",1
"1342","While there was enough variety in the mechs to keep me playing through a full season of matches, the sub-par visuals distract, and big matchmaking issues made online wait times unbearable. It’s fun to play with friends, but try to take it for a spin before committing, if only to make sure your stomach can actually handle it.",0
"1343","Although its clunky controls and inconsistent voice acting dates Heavy Rain, it still remains enjoyable (if mad) B-grade sholock. A stunning visual upgrade on the PlayStation 4 makes this the version to grab if you’re new to developer Quantic Dream’s games, and existing fans should find enjoyment in a richer aesthetic this time around.",1
"1344","Don't overlook Worms WMD. These cute-looking creatures are big fun on the battlefield.",1
"1345","Offworld Trading Company is fast-paced economic warfare with some clever capitalistic mind games to play with.",1
"1346","The colorful settings, beautiful soundtrack, and basic controls made it a great experience that constantly piqued my interest, even if it never challenged me to master it other than deciphering its cryptic environmental clues. Instead, Abzu relishes in giving you freedom to simply enjoy exploring the fascinating deep blue sea.",1
"1347","There's a massive amount of content in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, though especially if you played Black Ops 3 last year there’s little of it that’s particularly impressive.",1
"1348","It sports a wonderful, diverse cast of characters, places a clear emphasis on strong fundamental play, it gives competitive players a great online experience, and it does it all while looking gorgeous. Strictly in terms of mechanics and competitive features, Street Fighter 5 is just about peerless, but it has quite a ways to go before it stacks up against other fighting games - including its own predecessor - in terms of overall content.",1
"1349","Designing, flying, and then retrying missions again and again is a tough challenge that goes right up to the brink of frustration (and sometimes beyond the limits of the PlayStation 4’s performance), but the eventual success of achieving virtual space flight is rewarding and even inspirational.",1
"1350","Quantum Break is an artistically distinct shooter, with a compelling and malleable plot and excellent performances from its main players in both their digital and live-action forms. While I wish more thought had gone into maintaining the thrill of discovering its time-twisting powers from start to finish, it ultimately didn’t prevent me from thoroughly enjoying Quantum Break’s 10-hour campaign, two times over.",1
"1351","World of Final Fantasy is a humorous adventure that is just too cute for words, but its combat and exploration aren’t diverse enough to support a campaign nearly as long as this one. However, I did enjoy it for a long time - more than 30 hours - before it wore out its welcome.",0
"1352","Most importantly, the hockey presented on the ice is dynamic and fluid, and it serves up an excellent version of the fastest game around.",1
"1353","Chronos is a challenging puzzle/action-adventure, and one of the richest experiences available on Oculus Rift yet.",1
"1354","There are a lot of good ideas in Battlefleet Gothic: Armada, and it certainly looks like a great tactical space combat game. But it struggles to build that into a coherent whole, making it tough to recommend unless you’re willing to utterly dedicate yourself to fully comprehending the inaccessible systems of its combat.",0
"1355","There's a massive amount of content in Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, though especially if you played Black Ops 3 last year there’s little of it that’s particularly impressive.",1
"1356","The more I've played Hitman’s debut “episode” the more I've enjoyed it. Despite the often boneheaded AI and dire loading times, Hitman has definitely combined the best of both worlds. There’s scope for it to improve in some areas as the levels are released throughout the year but this is a fun, confident start.",1
"1357","Headlander is an unexpectedly great take on Metroidviania-style action. Some of the objective design renders its flashier, body-endangering powers moot, but the quick and complex moment-to-moment gameplay carries it splendidly.",1
"1358","Pokkén Tournament takes pieces from many fighting favorites and successfully blends them.",1
"1359","When it works and none of the seven players have any audio or connectivity issues, Werewolves Within is competitive, surprisingly friendly, easy to jump into and even easier to play for hours on end, building up an active repertoire of new online friends as you go. When it doesn’t work, though, it’s inexcusably hard to play, and that’s unfortunately very often.",0
"1360","Mario & Luigi’s great combat can’t make up for a dull story, flat humor, and tedious Toad Hunts.",0
"1361","EA Sports' UFC 2 has some technical skill, but is missing the heart of the sport.",0
"1362","The visceral and varied combat is fun, the beast-based gameplay is a winner, and the lure of camp-claiming, gear-crafting, beast hunting, and resource gathering remains irresistible. It’s weakened, however, by a disappointing lack of investment in its story, some often forgettable quests, and its vanilla villains, which unfortunately combine to make Primal feel like a step back from the memorable moments of Far Cry 3 and 4.",1
"1363","The beautiful Wii U graphics and playful humor stay true to the spirit of the Paper Mario franchise, but the story is straightforward and a bit bland.",0
"1364","While it finds its strongest moments in its rewardingly rhythmic, precision-based one-on-one duels, an unwelcome level of tedium and occasionally cheap sequences — made even more frustrating by janky mechanics — keep the action from being as consistently strong as it is visually stylish.",0
"1365","Firewatch is amazing for many reasons, but above all because it’s an adult game that deals with serious issues, with realistic adult dialogue to match. And it deals with those issues just like actual adults would: sometimes with humor, sometimes with anger, and sometimes with sadness.",1
"1366","In a time when shooters are competing to have the most modes, the biggest campaign, the most guns, and generally the most “stuff,” along comes Killing Floor 2, totally unconcerned with running that race. Its lack of modes and bosses will eventually turn away anyone but the most dedicated of fans, but its foundation is so fun and rock solid that, even if you only plan on playing for a few weeks with your friends, there’s plenty here to enjoy.",1
"1367","System Rift does an admirable job of tying Breach mode into the main story while starting to fill in the gaps between Human Revolution and Mankind Divided, but it doesn't feel complete unto itself. You’ll get two to four hours more of excellent Deus Ex gameplay, and a glimpse of what the future may hold, but not much more, which is just a bit of a tease.",1
"1368","Hitman Episode 3: Marrakesh doesn’t reach the highs of the previous levels and features the worst voice acting so far.",0
"1369","Being Batman in Akrham VR is a great way to more intimately experience Rocksteady's universe and to search for clues in this brief mystery. However, the world and characters around you are largely rigid and unresponsive to your actions, which leaves a lot on the table for a game about a character known as much for his brawn as he is for his brains.",0
"1370","Nuka-World has a great setting that’s densely packed with spectacle, surprises, and tough battles (depending on your level), and the ability to conquer settlements back on the main map is a fun novelty, but the lack of meaningful decisions leave it feeling more like an actual theme park ride than a choose-your-own-adventure story.",1
"1371","When I eventually, inevitably crashed, I was always hammering restart the moment the prompt appeared. That’s the mark of an amazing puzzle game.",1
"1372","A lack of balance robs the combat of much of its fun and renders many of the more interesting gameplay systems moot, but it didn’t dampen the emotional impact of I Am Setsuna’s heartfelt message for me.",1
"1373","Its mechanics are solid but largely unoriginal, and its themes and world-building are genuinely great. And while it never reaches the originality and heights of its inspirations, it still manages to deliver an interesting world with one heck of a twist.",0
"1374","It’s hard to criticize something that seems like it was tailor-made for a wannabe competitive player like me, but I just can’t ignore how little Street Fighter 5 does for the average fighting game player.",1
"1375","Star Fox Guard is a fun action-tower defense game about managing different perspectives to put out fires.",1
"1376","Despite its improved HD veneer and tweaked controls, I just didn’t find the Amplitude of 2016 to be as addictive or long-lasting an experience as the Amplitude of 2003.",0
"1377","Though the epilogue has some serious pacing problems, Attack on Titan is a fun, bloody take on the series.",0
"1378","Dead Rising 4 has the best core gameplay the series has ever seen. Its inventive and humorous ways to put down the dead are something I still haven’t tired of, and its surprisingly interesting plot is more than just a zombie-killing delivery system. Despite the technical blemishes that come with the series, its lack of co-op story mode play, and the fun-yet-unreliable multiplayer, Frank West’s return brings the series some fresh ideas, a ton of bloody mayhem, and a whole lot of cracking wise. Here’s hoping he sticks around for a while.",1
"1379","It’s difficult but fair, and fast-paced but satisfying through to the end. And with a story so dangerously loaded with trope upon trope, it’s a joy to see Headlander sidestep some cliches with a beautiful setting, dark humor, and, well… a rocket-powered head. That’ll do the trick.",1
"1380","I was so happy this game was being made, but in the end I’m just as disappointed in how it turned out.",0
"1381","Virginia shows instead of tells, with a raw, understated power and a calculated nuance that make even the smallest, most mundane details brim with narrative and emotional significance.",1
"1382","The three almost entirely separate characters and play-styles keep the familiar Telltale formula feeling fresh and inviting. While some of the dialogue does feel overly expositional, it’s hopefully only there to provide concrete padding for future episodes, and the gorgeous, high-action combat sequences and creative detective work provide the right amount of contrast.",1
"1383","A moderately successful execution of the standard 4X formula with a flair for leaders and enjoyably complex combat.",0
"1384","The core idea behind Super Mario Maker is the ability to create, play, and share your creation, but the 3DS drops the ball on the last part of that credo. It’s worth noting that designing stages is as easy at it is convenient on the portable 3DS, but not having a larger platform to showcase unique creations left me wondering what the point is. It’s still an excellent way to play a bottomless pit of classic-style 2D Mario, though, and that makes it worth keeping in your pocket.",0
"1385","A very predictable update to a long-running series of dancing games that shines in visual design and unique choreography but is very loose with its tracking of your body movements. It’s not going to teach you to be a professional dancer, and it honestly doesn’t really teach you how to be good at Just Dance itself. That said, it’s still a whole lot of fun to play, and the songs that aren’t locked behind a paywall are varied and, largely, recognisable.",0
"1386","While this is the weakest episode in Batman’s Telltale series yet, my investment in the unpredictable, multi-layered plot hasn’t wavered, thanks to the critical state of each of Bruce Wayne’s relationships. Episode four’s first act felt like it was just filling in time for the season finale, but some conflicts have still been built upon, including showcasing how the people of Gotham are reacting to the intense political climate.",0
"1387","Punch Club is tedious at times, thanks to an unfortunate level-down systems that artificially extend the road to the championship with grinding repetition, but its upgrades, stat growth, and more compensate with satisfying depth.",0
"1388","If you’ve never played Arkham Asylum and Arkham City and own a current-gen console, Return to Arkham is a fine place to start. But for those who already own both on PC or last gen, there’s no real reason to pick this up beyond a rather uninspiring and technically disappointing graphical upgrade.",0
"1389","The Painted World of Ariandel presents a land that’s both enticing and dangerous, and there’s plenty of challenges to face even if you won’t have to face them too many times. However, unless you really love dueling in PvP arenas and can find sustained interest there, this adventure may serve as more of an appetizer than a full course meal.",1
"1390","All flash with little substance, Project X Zone 2 will please die-hard fans of its source material but few others.",0
"1391","It’s a side-scrolling shooter with stock parts that I don’t foresee leaving a mark on the genre, but is at least worth a spin if you’ve got the patience for it and a thirst for a major challenge.",0
"1392","The campaign is ignorable and the multiplayer needs a little technical work to be as good as last year’s, but the overly silly Zombies mode keeps me coming back. It may not stand out in a year that’s been crowded with great shooters, but it still produces that familiar Call of Duty action.",1
"1393","Nova Covert Ops Mission Pack 1 stumbles by being too timid to fully flesh out some of its more interesting ideas.",0
"1394","I wish this expansion had focused more on fixing Destiny’s repetition problems, because it has a few good ideas — but with all its pitfalls, this is just Destiny going through the motions.",0
"1395","Eagle Flight surprised me with how quickly I felt at home flying and fighting with other birds above Paris. It features some of the best and most responsive and comfortable gameplay available on the PSVR, though like most current VR games its appeal may be short-lived if you’re not a completionist who’s crazy about collectibles or high scores. This is a weird idea, well executed, that soars high.",1
"1396","It’s a tribute to Telltale that the intricate, multi-layered plot and diverse cast of intertwined villains and madmen makes episode three’s lack of consequence and gameplay shortcomings excusable.",1
"1397","Despite its amazing driving simulation, Assetto Corsa just doesn’t get the racing right. Out on track alone it feels amazing; there’s no denying the remarkable realism Kunos Simulazioni has captured here. Unfortunately the team just hasn’t been able to wrap a comprehensive or competitive racing experience around it this time.",0
"1398","The Flame in the Flood is a beautiful procedurally generated survival sim that gains a welcome sense of momentum from the need to stay on the move. Its unwieldy menus and tendency to crash ruins some of the fun, unfortunately, but not enough to diminish the strength of the hopeful, riverbound journey at its core.",0
"1399","Throughout the early levels and into the more advanced stages, this fun, occasionally frustrating strategy game continues to offer plenty of reward for your time and effort, but lacks the character to make the spirit of the simulation as enticing as its systems.",0
"1400","Takes all of the solid foundations established by Episode 1, trims most of the fat, and continues to build an engaging Dark Knight story in a unique and uncharted version of the D.C. legend’s universe. Old Bat-fans will get much more out of the unexpected twists and turns than a newcomer, but the relationships Bruce Wayne forms and develops with the people around him appeal equally.",1
"1401","A brief, but mostly entertaining chapter in Rise of the Tomb Raider’s lore. While I would have happily swapped the return to the Soviet Installation for a new challenge tomb, its supernatural elements added a noticeably different feel and a welcome sense of tension to Lara’s new adventure.",0
"1402","Dead Rising 4 has the best core gameplay the series has ever seen. Its inventive and humorous ways to put down the dead are something I still haven’t tired of, and its surprisingly interesting plot is more than just a zombie-killing delivery system. Despite the technical blemishes that come with the series, its lack of co-op story mode play, and the fun-yet-unreliable multiplayer, Frank West’s return brings the series some fresh ideas, a ton of bloody mayhem, and a whole lot of cracking wise. Here’s hoping he sticks around for a while.",1
"1403","Layers of Fear lacks the surprises and subtlety needed to keep things interesting all the way through. It makes a strong first impression, but quickly exhausts its best ideas, making it hard for them to really shine as scary or meaningful moments. It’s hard to be terrified when you can see what’s coming at the end of every long dark hallway.",0
"1404","Wayward Sky is a good example of how well suited VR is for point-and-click style adventures. It uses perspective and gesture-based gameplay to immerse you in a world that is, on its own, a well made and inviting one. Though I’ll most likely forget forget much of its gameplay sooner than later, Wayward Sky’s setting and ambiance will stay with me long after.",0
"1405","The core snowboarding and skiing events are enjoyable enough to easily forgive mediocre elements, like the slow and sleepy paragliding mode, that feel like needless gimmicks. I just wish the latter weren’t mandatory.",1
"1406","The world can be fun to dive into, but actually playing Yo-kai Watch can shift from tedious to outright boring. For every new story idea or impressive blend of humor and pathos in its writing, Yo-kai Watch 2 fails to breathe life into the act of actually playing it, and until something’s done about all the issues with combat, no amount of delicious doughnuts can cover up its problems.",0
"1407","The staples of Mirror’s Edge remain refreshing and unique in the first-person genre in 2016, but Catalyst’s attempts to keep up with the open-world Joneses don’t always jive with its design strengths of movement and momentum. On top of that, muddy-looking console versions and a lame story filled with unlikable characters doom Mirror’s Edge’s return to fall short.",0
"1408","Let It Die has numerous rough edges, but it manages to entertain through the sheer force of its weird personality and its varied, if clumsy combat. The controls are often clunky and there's rarely a meaningful sense of attachment to characters or gear, but its characterizations and settings often manage to keep the pain of the poorer stuff down to a minimum, at least for a while.",0
"1409","Ezio’s trilogy helped build Assassin’s Creed into the giant franchise it is today thanks to its fantastic storytelling, amazing characters, and gorgeous world building. And while all of that is still here in The Ezio Collection, the lack of meaningful improvements and any sort of substantial bonus content make it a tough compilation to recommend.",0
"1410","Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2 is an ambitious , if rough-edged experience, with deceptively deep RPG and brawling elements.",1
"1411","A seemingly pointless resource management system presents some interesting aesthetics, but overall, Valley very rarely presents the challenge or consequence it really needs to be addictive.",0
"1412","Rise of Iron has just enough new content to keep me coming back for a while, but it feels like the bare minimum.",0
"1413","I enjoyed just about every minute I spent playing Steep. Grandiose, attractive environments serving as the backdrop to varied, intense challenges are enough on their own to make this wintry playground somewhere I was always delighted to go back to and spend more time in - a feeling I still have even after finishing the bulk of the content, though the lack of mechanical customization and progression makes it harder to find reasons to return.",1
"1414","Even as a mere horror-flavored rail shooter lacking in any serious scares, Until Dawn: Rush of Blood isn’t terrible. Responsive, arcade-style shooting, the frequency of collectibles, optional side passages that add some sense of exploration to the linear rollercoaster, and an end-of-level letter grade system offer plenty of casual replayability. Coupled with its smooth, motion-based controls, and barring some of its weaker stages, Rush of Blood actually makes for a decently fun ride.",0
"1415","The bottom line is if you haven’t played any three of these games, this is the best looking console version to date, and these enduring zombie-smashing games are still worth a playthrough. Outside of that, there’s nothing new in this Triple Pack to draw old Frank West fans back to experience the chaos again before he returns in Dead Rising 4 this December.",0
"1416","Though it doesn't introduce many game-changing ideas, Grow Up takes B.U.D. to a bigger playground to climb in.",1
"1417","Despite being a relatively-simple 3D platformer, Bound’s fantastic sense of movement and strange, dream-like world make it utterly unique. It’s a testament to phenomenal controls and sense of grace that I was able to set aside the camera and design flaws, and fully immerse myself in this strange, beautiful story.",0
"1418","I enjoyed just about every minute I spent playing Steep. Grandiose, attractive environments serving as the backdrop to varied, intense challenges are enough on their own to make this wintry playground somewhere I was always delighted to go back to and spend more time in - a feeling I still have even after finishing the bulk of the content, though the lack of mechanical customization and progression makes it harder to find reasons to return.",1
"1419","Job Simulator's simple tasks are made fun by its absurdist sense of humor and goofy props. It'll test the limits of the PlayStation VR's motion tracking abilities by enticing you to reach for every object and device you can see, which sometimes makes things a little frustrating. But the rewards for experimentation make it well worth doing.",1
"1420","Tumblestone is a clever and intriguing puzzle game... with a somewhat confusing selling model and and awful art department.",1
"1421","The cast of Battleborn is fantastic; I've enjoyed exploring the ins and outs of characters like the steampunk sniper Marquis and fungal healer Miko, and every time I play I'm focused on earning further access to the unique roster. However, there’s no interesting story for them to take part in, and a lack of interesting stages and multiplayer modes inspiring me to power through the slow unlocking process.",0
"1422","LEGO Marvel's Avengers is fun, but unfortunately restricted by stubbornly sticking to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",0
"1423","The Painted World of Ariandel presents a land that’s both enticing and dangerous, and there’s plenty of challenges to face even if you won’t have to face them too many times. However, unless you really love dueling in PvP arenas and can find sustained interest there, this adventure may serve as more of an appetizer than a full course meal.",1
"1424","Progression and microtransaction problems aside, after a VR stint in EVE Valkyrie I don’t think I’ll ever be able to go back to playing a dogfighting game on a regular screen. It’s just too good at showing me what I’ve been missing by not being able to look around freely as I pursue or evade targets. The intense and movie-like moments of strafing an enemy carrier while dodging incoming fire are a thrill.",1
"1425","Ezio’s trilogy helped build Assassin’s Creed into the giant franchise it is today thanks to its fantastic storytelling, amazing characters, and gorgeous world building. And while all of that is still here in The Ezio Collection, the lack of meaningful improvements and any sort of substantial bonus content make it a tough compilation to recommend.",0
"1426","Edge of Nowhere stands out in the current library of VR games only because it’s one of the longer and more polished games out there, but compared to the conventional third-person action-stealth games it closely emulates it’s competent but unremarkable. [Tested with Oculus Rift]",0
"1427","After two episodes, The Walking Dead: Michonne successfully developed its main character at the expense of the rest of its cast. In Episode 3, the trade-off doesn’t feel quite worth it — it’s so concerned with drawing explicit connections and tying every thread together that it isn’t that satisfying as an ending. A critical reveal redeems it somewhat, but once the episode begins to over explain that, too, the impact sadly fades.",0
"1428","No Man's Sky reaches for the stars but falls short by light years. It's amazingly big, but too often poorly designed.",0
"1429","Human: Fall Flat’s slapstick controls and ridiculous animation do a great job of making repeated, frustrating, and unfair failure at physics puzzles seem fun for a while. And when that fun runs out, you can extend it by bringing in a friend and drawing silly things on your goofball character. If you don’t play it, watch someone play it.",1
"1430","In a way it’s a nice change-up to the established formula to date but the drab and gloomy farm isn’t an especially memorable environment. It is, however, the trickiest series of hits this season thanks to a big push for stealth, and probably the lengthiest episode so far.",0
"1431","On the whole, Hyrule Warriors Legends is an ok experience for New 3DS owners. Despite adding five awesome characters and some smart control-swapping and fast-travel options, the performance problems and shabby-looking graphics make it difficult to appreciate all the fanservice that’s packed in here. The poorly downgraded textures, hideous menus, and pop-in are all real eyesores. And stay away from 3D if you prefer a stable framerate.",0
"1432","The world can be fun to dive into, but actually playing Yo-kai Watch can shift from tedious to outright boring. For every new story idea or impressive blend of humor and pathos in its writing, Yo-kai Watch 2 fails to breathe life into the act of actually playing it, and until something’s done about all the issues with combat, no amount of delicious doughnuts can cover up its problems.",0
"1433","Dead Star has the basics of combat and ship balance right, to the point that even losses have their fun moments. Its primary shortcoming is that it allows too great an advantage for pre-made groups, which is especially a problem considering the wonky matchmaker.",0
"1434","For a few hours at least, Final Fantasy Explorers is a charming little adventure that’s fun to play alone with your monster buddies or with real-life friends. But repetitive quests, the lack of a serious challenge until late in the story and a poor travel system eventually broke the charm spell that Explorers had cast upon me.",0
"1435","True to its title, The Walking Dead: Michonne - Episode 1 is all about one character, somewhat to the detriment of the story and other characters. Michonne is so well done, though, from her impressive survival skills to the hollow look in her eyes, that she easily carries the entire episode.",0
"1436","Progression and microtransaction problems aside, after a VR stint in EVE Valkyrie I don’t think I’ll ever be able to go back to playing a dogfighting game on a regular screen. It’s just too good at showing me what I’ve been missing by not being able to look around freely as I pursue or evade targets.

"1437","Once you break free from the tactics-focused mindset of most RTS games, Ashes of the Singularity is a challenging, engrossing, and cerebral exercise in strategy that has me mentally iterating on army compositions, build timings, and board deployment schemes even when I’m not playing it.",1
"1438","Insomniac's Song of the Deep is a beautiful Metroidvania robbed of much of its potential magic.",0
"1439","Battleborn's fun heroes and leveling will keep you hooked despite a lack of content.",0
"1440","A lot of effort was clearly put into Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization, because almost every aspect of its gameplay has an underlying set of properties and nuances to come to grips with. While I usually love that kind of complexity, here it rarely felt meaningful or even coherent. Paired with a story that lacks the stakes and urgency of the source material, it leaves Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization feeling pretty tepid aside from its enjoyable combat.",0
"1441","The staples of Mirror’s Edge remain refreshing and unique in the first-person genre in 2016, but Catalyst’s attempts to keep up with the open-world Joneses don’t always jive with its design strengths of movement and momentum.

"1442","Star Fox Zero’s fun stages and impressive boss fight give me lot of reasons to jump back in and play them over and over, and especially enjoyed them in co-op until I got a hang of juggling two screens myself. I’ve played 15 hours and I still haven’t found everything. Learning to use the unintuitive controls is a difficult barrier to entry, though it comes with a payoff if you can stick with it.",1
"1443","Underground mixes people of low and high gear level, creating a poor experience for both.",0
"1444","We’re mostly just stacking blocks in Tumble VR, and that’s rarely going to be exciting. Even when it challenged me with head-scratching feats of structural engineering it bored me with the mundanity of its theme. Adding onto that some of the PlayStation VR’s inherent limitations with tracking, and it was as often frustrating as rewarding.",0
"1445","Reanimating this limp corpse of a survival game in high definition only brings back the disappointment I felt when I played it the first time.",0
"1446","I really miss 2K Showcase, and 2K17 is still weak in areas that I feel should have been shored up by now, but its excellent combat, and generous amounts of customization help it retain its title.",1
"1447","WWE 2K17 doesn’t make any big, drastic changes, but its smart gameplay tweaks have revitalized match types I’d ignored the past few years. I really miss 2K Showcase, and 2K17 is still weak in areas that I feel should have been shored up by now, but its excellent combat, and generous amounts of customization help it retain its title.",1

"1449","There are some interesting ideas scattered throughout the world but they’re very hard to care about, since there’s nobody around to be influenced by your actions.",0
"1450","It might not hold a candle to Dirt Rally in its car selection or look and feel, but it’s not bad for developer Kylotonn’s sophomore effort on the series. If Milestone’s stint turned you off, as it did me, now could be a good time to get reacquainted.",0
"1451","It’s a forgettable entry in an outstanding series that just doesn’t measure up because of its story problems, overwhelming inventory management, and horrible predictability.",0
"1452","Mafia 3’s strong characters and confident storytelling kept me engaged, even if the gameplay rarely delivered anything but bog-standard and repetitive open-world action.",1
"1453","The results are satisfying. The story mode is brief, the narrative is mundane, and sadly the all-too-familiar Fallout 4 bugs are still hanging around, but the overall experience is rewarding, imaginative, and a pleasure to play.",1
"1454","Lincoln is an incredible protagonist and New Bordeaux is a fantastic setting thematically, and it would’ve been great to see them put to better use.",1
"1455","With the Dead Island Definitive Edition, Dead Island and Dead Island Riptide have never looked so good. The use of Dying Light's graphics engine means almost every setting looks better and more realistic than it did at the start of the decade, but it unfortunately doesn’t run any better now than it did then.",0
"1456","In small doses, I think it does its job of demonstrating the potential of VR racing. The racing genre is perfect for seated VR, and Driveclub VR delivers a functional example of that experience. Unfortunately, that’s really about all it delivers. Beyond that it’s just a pre-existing game with fewer features and graphics that make me feel like I have the vision of a 95-year-old man.",0
"1457","It’s great to have something made just for fans, though even Luffy's biggest supporters will be let down by the brief, limited campaign. At its best, this wild and crazy fighter makes for a fun distraction for folks who've been dying for more One Piece games to get localized.",0
"1458","Michonne is undoubtedly a strong star, but the rest of the characters fall short as a supporting cast — they’re mostly backdrops and mirrors for Michonne to look into. It doesn’t hurt her character development, but it takes some of the emotion out of otherwise-powerful scenes that clearly affect Michonne deeply.",0
"1459","It might not hold a candle to Dirt Rally in its car selection or look and feel, but it’s not bad for developer Kylotonn’s sophomore effort on the series. If Milestone’s stint turned you off, as it did me, now could be a good time to get reacquainted.",0
"1460","Reminds me a lot of the PlayStation 2-era Evolution-developed WRC games; it’s an earnest attempt to capture the spirit of a niche motorsport series and, most importantly, it feels good to play thanks to a wide selection of tight-quarters race tracks, and decent handling. It might not hold a candle to Dirt Rally in its car selection or look and feel, but it’s not bad for developer Kylotonn’s sophomore effort on the series.",0
"1461","There’s some charm to Lucky’s Tale’s simplicity. It’s not exciting, but it’s finely polished. Old-fashioned 3D platforming is still fun, especially some of the boss battles, which require more precise jumping and dodging than any of the more slowly paced levels. It’s just not remarkable, especially as a showcase for VR.",0
"1462","Metroid Prime: Federation Force has some neat ideas, but they’re soured by an impotent and boring primary weapon that sucks the enjoyment out of shooting and a bewildering lack of special ammunition that might’ve brought variety to the action. Due to a painfully imbalanced single-player experience co-op with friends is really the only viable way to play it, and even then it’s not really recommended.",0
"1463","Long after its many blood-soaked dismemberments fade from my memory, I’ll remember just how alien and otherworldly it felt between the fits of violence.",1
"1464","Robinson: The Journey is a beautiful world to explore, and being in the presence of dinosaurs can be awe-inspiring. However, almost everything about it that makes it a game rather than a non-interactive virtual experience is unpleasant. Slow progress and poor direction kills the momentum, extending what could be a four-hour experience into something nearly twice as long, and makes even the amazing-looking environments feel stale.",0
"1465","In terms of presentation, Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: India remedies the stiff sense of joylessness that pervades Chronicles: China by injecting more color and personality wherever it seemed possible. That renewed energy only makes it more disappointing that the generally well-designed missions have given way to the artifice of cheap-feeling instant deaths.",0
"1466","Adr1ft doesn't pioneer any new types of gameplay with VR, which is a shame because it desperately needs some variety in that area. However, it does benefit greatly from blocking off the rest of the world, creating a feeling of isolation that aligns with what your character is experiencing. Floating out over the Earth and looking down from this perspective is truly impressive. [VR Tested]",0
"1467","With around 35 hours of gameplay packed in and a fun little retro beat 'em up to complement it all, though, it's the best way to play if you missed these zombie-smashers.",0
"1468","Perhaps its biggest issue, at least on console, is its shoddy overall performance. While a mid or even lower range PC can handle ReCore just fine even at max settings, the Xbox One version rarely if ever manages to make it to 30 fps. It never interfered with my ability to play in any significant manner, but it definitely degrades the visual joy of exploring Far Eden a bit.",0

"1471","While Fire and Ice’s art direction and music are woefully generic, the well-constructed level layouts create a solid arcade-style experience that accomplishes a sense of extraordinary speed while accommodating a reasonable degree of control. Sonic Boom successfully draws from much of what makes the best of classic Sonic game play satisfying, sprinkles in a better-conceived exploratory structure, and remixes it into an intelligent, cohesive, and rewarding package.",1
"1472","Disappoints on multiple levels, from a flat main character to unintuitive insta-fail stealth levels to clumsy combat and platforming. The few times it nails it with diorama-like puzzles and Helix powers only serve to make the rest of this side-scrolling spinoff look even worse by comparison.",0
"1473","The Park doesn’t really bring anything new to the horror table, but honestly, that’s okay. Its 90 minutes are filled with an impressive atmosphere, interesting themes, and spooky places to poke around. While some of the attractions are a bit long in the tooth, The Park provides enough tension and scares to warrant a playthrough from any horror fan.",0
"1474","The Dwarves boasts a strong story that's taken from a bestselling novel, and it generally honors that lineage with a cast of likable and ably voiced characters. It's a good foundation, but unfortunately it's not strong enough to make up for the deficiencies of its gameplay, which include unfulfilling RPG elements and a stubborn camera.",0
"1475","One Piece: Burning Blood understands what makes the pirate life so compelling in the source material, and is fairly successful in channelling that roguish spirit into its chaotic fights. That flashy, firm commitment to action will feel welcoming to One Piece's biggest fans, but confusing to everyone else.",0
"1476","Some of its ideas conflict with each other (such as permadeath and teammate revival), its procedural generation doesn’t offer much in the way of replayability, and its intentional vagueness can be frustrating, but it’s good for at least a few monster-smashing runs before it gets old thanks to enjoyable combat mechanics, cheeky humor, and the promise of mystery.",0
"1477","Controls are awkward at best, making it tough to appreciate how good the combat is, but there's a lot of fun here, especially in the eight multiplayer modes for up to 32 players.",0
"1478","It’s a shame these four games and one sightseeing trip aren’t sold separately, because as a mismatched hodgepodge it’s a lot harder to recommend as a whole than the good parts would have been on their own.",0
"1479","The newest Star Ocean is a serviceable JPRG marred by uneven production values and poor A.I.",0
"1480","There's a lot to love in the way Clockwork Empires attempts to break up the construction sim framework with Lovecraftian creatures and almost assured destruction, but it often takes too long to get to the best parts and fills that time with dull busywork. For most of the hours spent, it's largely a standard colonization simulator that's hampered with an unwieldy user interface and weak AI.",0
"1481","Space Hulk: Deathwing is that paradoxical game that’s hard to dislike, but also hard to love. The glorious moments of fervent xeno-purging are too fleeting, and often left me standing in dark corridors, surrounded by my slain foes, looking for any kind of context or sense of lasting accomplishment.",0
"1482","Its world, while interesting to explore for a good while, is ultimately too big with too little happening in it to be a totally serviceable housing for the strong combat and platforming gameplay within. It feels like a great, arcadey action platformer spread across too big a canvas, and it asks you to draw back over the same lines a few too many times.",0
"1483","The Dwarves boasts a strong story that's taken from a bestselling novel, and it generally honors that lineage with a cast of likable and ably voiced characters. It's a good foundation, but unfortunately it's not strong enough to make up for the deficiencies of its gameplay, which include unfulfilling RPG elements and a stubborn camera.",0
"1484","Much like you'd see in a seedy 1980s movie, Trials of the Blood Dragon is like a pretty good first hit of a drug. The buzz is short and mostly enjoyable, but it's so different that you might get hooked on the series.",0
"1485","The lack of any original modes or meaningful progression prevents Hardware: Rivals from having any chance at longevity. Aside from the awkward controls, everything works well enough, but nothing is memorable or satisfying.",0
"1486","It's got a great gateway due to the story's ties to Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, the flashy neon art, the constant pop-culture references, and fantastic techno score. Just realize that the shooting is bad and that you may come down from this high way earlier than you'd expect. But if this is your first Trial, know that there's lots more to consume.",0
"1487","The Park doesn’t really bring anything new to the horror table, but honestly, that’s okay.

While some of the attractions are a bit long in the tooth, The Park provides enough tension and scares to warrant a playthrough from any horror fan.",0
"1488","Though its world has some great aesthetic devices and a cool concept, ultimately all of Homefront: The Revolution’s elements feel repetitive, unpolished, or downright unnecessary. Over the length of its campaign it fails to deliver a satisfying - or even fully functional - shooter experience.",0
"1489","Gemini: Heroes Reborn is short, drab, and derivative, but it nevertheless generally remains fun throughout its five-hour running time. In its best moments, it mixes familiar elements from beloved platformers and puzzlers to create an experience that, at least for brief moments, captures the essence of the show.",0
"1490","You have to admire where The Tomorrow Children does innovate—particularly its look and social engineering—but it overly burdens you and bogs down progression with dragging resource collection and bureaucratic manipulation. Even though you immediately progress from a Prole to the ranks of the papered Bourgeoisie you’re still tediously grinding for the man.",0
"1491","Dangerous Golf breaks new ground, walls and furniture for golf games, but its novelty doesn't last.",0
"1492","It currently doesn't offer the amount of content I’d expect from a $50 game. Balance and optimization issues also complicate the fun, as do missing elements in the shop and unfinished features that all suggest Eternal Crusade was released a bit too soon.",0
"1493","Despite its pedigree, Mighty No. 9 doesn’t seem to have a good sense of what was fun about Mega Man, or 2D action-platformers in general. There are brief moments where its pieces come together, but even then it’s hamstrung by its visually joyless art and animation. The soul of the Blue Bomber just isn’t here, and worse yet there’s no endearing personality of its own, and as a result, Mighty No. 9 feels much more like a second-rate imposter than a spiritual successor.",0
"1494","Max Damage is a collection of ideas that looked good on paper and sounded good in its Kickstarter pitch, but in practice it would only have been an acceptable sequel if it’d come out in 1999.",0
"1495","Max Damage is a collection of ideas that looked good on paper and sounded good in its Kickstarter pitch, but in practice it would only have been an acceptable sequel if it’d come out in 1999.",0
"1496","A fast-paced, energetic, deliberately absurd action shooter that’s mostly competent at everything it tries to do. Stunningly crafted, downright epic environments and tight, responsive gamepad controls steal the show. But it certainly doesn’t pull off anything innovative or revolutionary, and the whole experience is dragged down by spiky difficulty, half-baked RPG mechanics, and poorly constructed (though varied) boss battles.",0
"1497","The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild is a masterclass in open-world design and a watershed game that reinvents a 30-year-old franchise. It presents a wonderful sandbox full of mystery, dangling dozens upon dozens of tantalizing things in front of you that just beg to be explored. I’ve had so many adventures in Breath of the Wild, and each one has a unique story behind what led me to them, making them stories on top of stories. And even after I’ve spent more than 50 hours searching the far reaches of Hyrule, I still manage to come across things I haven’t seen before. I’ll easily spend 50 to 100 more trying to track down its fascinating moments.",1
"1498","Mario’s games have been around for almost as long as game consoles have been a thing, but thankfully, he’s always evolving. We rarely get the same Mario twice. Super Mario Odyssey delivers on that ongoing promise of originality and innovation: It distills the venerable series’ joyful, irreverent world and characters and best-in-class platforming action, and introduces a steady stream of new and unexpected mechanics. It’s all spun together into a generational masterpiece.",1
"1499","Divinity: Original Sin 2 may have been designed in the spirit of decades-old RPGs like Baldur’s Gate 2, but that legacy serves only as a foundation for the expansive game Larian has built on top of it. Few other RPGs allow such a wide range of flexibility while also supporting rewarding combat and a powerful story, all in a world that feels alive in the ways it reacts to you and goes about its business without you. It's a rare RPG that I’ll want to play through again and again, driven by the feeling that so many fascinating and surprising paths remain undiscovered, some of which might lead to different outcomes for the NPCs I’ve grown to care about – even the rats. When that happens, you're experiencing something worth remembering, and Divinity: Original Sin 2 will be remembered as one of the greats.",1
"1500","Persona 5 is a massive, gorgeous JRPG with well over 100 hours of gameplay for completionists. With more to do than ever and the series’ strongest story to date, it stands out as an extraordinary, memorable experience and easily one of the deepest JRPGs of the last decade. Its sprawling dungeon design and stylish, fully realized world are an absolute joy to explore, and even after three playthroughs and the Platinum trophy, I find myself itching to go back to try different dialogue options with Confidants or revisit particularly fun puzzles. This is a new gold standard for Japanese RPGs and by far the best entry in the series yet.",1
"1501","After playing through Undertale on PS4, I’m happy to report that everything was ported over to console perfectly (including the clever takes on saved games and more)...It's a masterfully crafted experience that I won't forget any time soon.",1
"1502","An amazing game for all the same reasons I mentioned in our original review. It’s still a gorgeous kart racer and every bit as addictive as it was in 2014. This is the best entry in the series so far, and it has all the content you’ll need. Returning players have seen a lot of this game before, but the overhauled Battle mode and its five additional ways to play are a great reason to pick it up. Nintendo didn’t do enough to make the online experience better, but the rest of this game holds up well.",1
"1503","This is the best version of Shovel Knight yet, and Treasure Trove is the most complete package. In addition to piling ever more new features on top of the original, Yacht Club has improved on Shovel Knight in nearly every way with the Specter of Torment expansion. From the story and writing to the simple fluidness of platforming and combat, Specter Knight is an excellent new step for the series.",1
"1504","Rich with details and faithful to just about everything that makes contemporary F1 tick, F1 2017 is about as good a simulation of a single, modern motorsport as you can get.",1
"1505","Stormblood doesn't do much to shake up the general design Final Fantasy XIV has followed since its relaunch, but never before have its familiar elements worked quite so well.",1
"1506","Lone Echo and Echo Arena are the rare games that demonstrate the true value of VR and hand tracking. Its sense of movement feels great, and it couldn’t exist in any other way. Lone Echo’s well-acted story and interesting environments move at a slow enough pace that you can soak it all in and appreciate the sensation of virtual weightlessness before jumping into the fast, sweaty, competitive action of Echo Arena. The fact that you can experience the multiplayer without even buying it means it’s one of the first things any Oculus Rift owner should download.",1
"1507","Across a vast and beautiful open world, Horizon: Zero Dawn juggles many moving parts with polish and finesse. Its main activity - combat - is extremely satisfying thanks to the varied design and behaviors of machine-creatures that roam its lands, each of which needs to be taken down with careful consideration. Though side questing could have been more imaginative, its missions are compelling thanks to a central mystery that led me down a deep rabbit hole to a genuinely surprising - and moving - conclusion.",1
"1508","In our testing on live servers the online multiplayer was as solid as a Kryptonian, with minimal frame delay and no freezing or lag stutters.",1
"1509","Though it only took me just under two hours to complete, the second the credits stopped rolling I immediately restarted What Remains of Edith Finch. Each of the vignettes is so distinct and surprising that I didn’t have enough time to absorb and dissect what I had just played before being whisked away to the next one. But after fully piecing together the threads of the family and sifting through the allegories of their final moments, I was left with a beautiful, heartbreaking mosaic that exudes life, even when mired in death.",1
"1510","War of the Chosen is a wide and deep expansion for XCOM 2 that improves variety in mission objectives, tactical options, threats, and strategic map activities.",1
"1511","Though it only took me just under two hours to complete, the second the credits stopped rolling I immediately restarted What Remains of Edith Finch.

"1512","Everything that made Wolfenstein: The New Order an excellent single-player first-person shooter is dialed up for round two. With a cast of instantly likeable heroes and bone-chilling villains giving emotional context to its bloody uprising against high-tech Nazis, Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus has come to play.",1
"1513","Nier: Automata is a crazy, beautiful, and highly entertaining journey full of nutty ideas and awesome gameplay. It may not include the most sensical story or compelling characters, but its frenzied combat -- coupled with beautiful visuals and a stunning soundtrack – make it too much fun to pass up.",1
"1514","SteamWorld Dig 2 retains the original’s addictive resource-gathering gameplay, but supplements it with a gorgeously detailed, handcrafted world. Its heady mix of exploration, combat, platforming, and puzzle solving, alongside an expansive set of abilities and mods gives it plenty of variety and a great gameplay rhythm. I wish there was more to do once the campaign ends, but that’s a testament to the fact that what is here is just about pitch perfect.",1
"1515","Its ability to swerve from the amusing hijinks of its vibrant heroes into very real, and very serious subject matter without feeling forced or unnatural was a pleasant surprise that kept me invested in its character drama long after I’d said goodbye to Possum Springs for the first time. But just like Mae, I know I’ll be back soon.",1
"1516","Nex Machina is not for the faint of heart, but a recipe to delight those looking for an attractive, arcadey challenge to overcome.",1
"1517","Nioh could well take over 100 hours if you set out to master its many side missions on top of its tough campaign, but it’s a challenge well worth taking. The way it builds on its most obvious inspirations with a highly refined combat system and an unexpectedly charming, yet gritty style all its own allows it to boldly carve out its own identity, standing as a shining example of what action RPGs can be.",1
"1518","You'll find some boring sidequests, yes, but it makes up for that flaw with an unforgettable story filled with moving cutscenes and acting, great new primal fights and dungeons, two wonderful new combat classes, and new lands that reward the explorer in us all.",1
"1519","The unrivaled amount of single-player content to explore, especially the highlight Multiverse mode, and the height of Injustice 2’s skill ceiling make it an easy environment in which to lose hours of your day without ever even challenging another human… or giant telekinetic gorilla, as it were.",1
"1520","Night in the Woods captures the fears and anxieties of being a young adult with surprising clarity, but brings it into new and interesting territory thanks to its developers’ deep understanding of rural America’s economic hardships. Branching, well-written dialogue made me feel closer to Mae’s story as I helped build out her history and reignite friendships, encouraging a second playthrough to uncover the scenes (and even a few secrets) I know I missed.",1
"1521","Hollow Knight is a Metroidvania with a well of content to discover that’s as deep as its labyrinthine caves. The world of Hallownest is compelling and rich, full of story that’s left for you to discover on your own, and built with branching paths that offer an absurd amount of choice in how you go about discovering it. With such a high density of secrets to find and fun, challenging enemies to face, it’s worth spending every moment you can in Hollow Knight.",1
"1522","A fantastic single-player shooter, but what really got me invested was the brilliantly written characters and the performances of its cast. BJ and his crew are full of spirit and personality, and General Engel is as memorable a nemesis as you’re likely to find in games. Machine Games has once again turned the well-worn act of mowing down Nazis into something to get excited about.",1
"1523","Destiny 2 is a blast out of the gate thanks to its excellent co-op shooter gameplay and strong storytelling in the campaign. Not all the features I’d expected to find are here, but it does deliver the same kind of highly social gameplay and rewarding, loot-driven progression that helped the original keep me hooked for hundreds of hours. The main concerns right now are a few bugs and lack of event options, but I’ll definitely be sticking around to see this big, action-packed universe develop over time.",1
"1524","The story and objective-driven campaign is a league above anything we’ve seen in the entire Total War series before in both design and presentation.",1
"1525","A delightful, daring, and different expansion that reinforces Forza Horizon 3’s reputation as one of the best racing games ever made.",1
"1526","But it’s the music and sounds of Thumper that will stick with me the most, beckoning me back to that terrifying abyss for several more hours to come.",1
"1527","While I did notice some occasional rubberbanding on the Switch while playing on the go – which is likely a symptom of having to use WiFi in handheld mode – the majority of my online matches were smooth and consistent and all platforms.",1
"1528","Rich with details and faithful to just about everything that makes contemporary F1 tick, F1 2017 is about as good a simulation of a single, modern motorsport as you can get.",1
"1529","Cuphead made me feel more good and more bad than any other game I’ve played in the last several years. I swore, laughed, and hollered with delight. I hated it (and my own fingers) for long stretches but, having finished, I realise that’s more or less the point – I emerged from all that pain smiling. Rather than simply offering the player what they want, Cuphead makes them earn that right – the rewards, if you can hack the tests, are absolutely worth it. Cuphead is incredible for more than just its looks. But before you dive in, make sure you actually want a game that plays like this, and not just a game that looks like this.",1
"1530","The outstanding classic-style RPG Pillars of Eternity makes a surprisingly virtuosic transition to the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 with the Complete Edition, bringing both systems all of the content that's been released on the PC version so far.",1
"1531","The Nintendo Switch version provides an authentic Minecraft experience that is hugely benefitted by the ability to play it anywhere with physical controls. The one drawback is the lack of voice chat, which makes online multiplayer less fun than on other platforms, so it’s best enjoyed in the same room as your friends.",1
"1532","Resident Evil 7 grounds itself in elements that made the original great while still indulging in a risky new shift in style that both helps and hurts the beloved formula in equal measure. But it’s also the closest a numbered sequel has come to recapturing Resident Evil’s slow, but thrilling and atmospheric adventure game roots in a while — a welcome return that I truly hope to see more of in the future.",1
"1533","Final Fantasy XII’s relatable roleplaying adventure has aged remarkably well, and The Zodiac Age remaster improves it further in meaningful ways. The storytelling, visual design, and gameplay feel just as fresh and interesting as they did over a decade ago, and the various new enhancements and adjustments will give new players a chance to experience the magic for the first time and fans of the original something enticing to return for.",1
"1534","A fantastic single-player shooter, but what really got me invested was the brilliantly written characters and the performances of its cast. BJ and his crew are full of spirit and personality, and General Engel is as memorable a nemesis as you’re likely to find in games. Machine Games has once again turned the well-worn act of mowing down Nazis into something to get excited about.",1
"1535","It truly is the classic throwback longtime series fans have been clamoring for, but there’s plenty to love here even if you didn’t grow up with a Genesis. Sonic Mania is a stellar example of a retro revival done right.",1
"1536","Resident Evil 7 grounds itself in elements that made the original great while still indulging in a risky new shift in style that both helps and hurts the beloved formula in equal measure. But it’s also the closest a numbered sequel has come to recapturing Resident Evil’s slow, but thrilling and atmospheric adventure game roots in a while — a welcome return that I truly hope to see more of in the future.",1
"1537","PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds has taken the military-sim gameplay popularized by games like ARMA and DayZ, boiled it down to its most exciting parts, and streamlined it into quick and accessible rounds of pure, hassle-free, survival-based action. Even though each game starts the same way, its remarkable ability to feel like a new, tense adventure each and every round has kept me coming back for hours on end.",1
"1538","Robo Recall is an excellent demonstration of what a VR shooter can be on Oculus Touch. Thanks to highly physical action and tons of options for smashing a bunch of great-looking robots with both magically replenishing guns and your bare hands, the three available maps feel like plenty.",1
"1539","Accessible yet tough and grimy yet gorgeous, Dirt 4 sets a new standard in rally racing – and its well-considered career mode and endless stages inject it with tremendous stamina. Absolutely stonking brilliant.",1
"1540","Microsoft pitched Forza Motorsport 7 as the ultimate automotive playset, and it’s hard to argue otherwise. With enough cars to fill a dozen museums and the most generous selection of tracks to date in the series, the amount of driving, experimenting, and racing here is absolutely mammoth. Accessible as always for beginners but crammed with content targeted at lifelong car junkies, Forza Motorsport 7 is Turn 10’s finest love letter to speed and style this generation, no matter what language you speak.",1
"1541","Like 1-2-Switch and Graceful Explosion Machine, Thumper uses the Switch’s HD Rumble feature to add a subtle texture to the physical feedback. It really feels like you’re scraping against the edges of the track and slamming into its sharp turns, which adds to the physical brutality that makes Thumper so distinct.",1
"1542","While it’s been marketed as a remake of Metroid II: The Return of Samus for Game Boy, Metroid: Samus Returns is more of a much-needed reboot of the 2D Metroid games we know and love. It’s a safe, modern take on Super Metroid, one of the greatest games of all time. Aside from some repetitive boss fights and hand-cramping controls, it’s nearly everything I could ask for as a fan of old-school Metroids.",1
"1543","Dragon Quest VIII was one of the finest JRPGs upon its initial release and it manages to retain that lofty status through this 3DS edition. Its adherence to the traditional rules of the genre is where it pulls its strength from, the familiarity of the template allowing the design team to worry about making sure each element is as good as it can possibly can be.",1
"1544","The outstanding classic-style RPG Pillars of Eternity makes a surprisingly virtuosic transition to the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 with the Complete Edition, bringing both systems all of the content that's been released on the PC version so far.",1
"1545","Funny and fresh from beginning to end, Paradigm is a traditional point-and-click adventure game full of heart and decapitated heads in jars. The Eastern European setting, great voice acting, and confident comedy shine throughout its roughly six hours. Relatively simple puzzles aside, Paradigm offers a fresh and memorable entry in a genre that I'm happy to see alive and well in 2017.",1
"1546","To distinguish itself from the MOBA crowd, Battlerite went for pure, skill-based action and hit the mark dead center. The fluid mouse-and-WASD-driven combat makes every move count and the quick pace of its 10-minute matches never lets off the gas. Even with its lackluster randomized progression system robbing it of momentum, Battlerite keeps me coming back to improve and add to my bag of tricks along the way. Stunlock’s approach to MOBA combat creates a near-even playing field that makes each outplay feel earned, whether it was me or my foe picking up the win. These arenas are places I can see myself brawling for a long time to come.",1
"1547","Assassin’s Creed Origins is a deep-dive into a truly stunning realization of ancient Egypt, with a rich series of cultures, genuine characters, and more mission variety than any other game in the series.",1
"1548","The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+ adds more of what we loved about the original and keeps the formula fresh. It’s a tough game, but one that balances challenge with a refreshing feeling of the unexpected. The unpredictable items and varied enemies make it one of the most wacky and replayable games I’ve ever experienced.",1
"1549","SteamWorld Dig 2 retains the original’s addictive resource-gathering gameplay, but supplements it with a gorgeously detailed, handcrafted world. Its heady mix of exploration, combat, platforming, and puzzle solving, alongside an expansive set of abilities and mods gives it plenty of variety and a great gameplay rhythm. I wish there was more to do once the campaign ends, but that’s a testament to the fact that what is here is just about pitch perfect.",1
"1550","While its melee combat may lag slightly behind modern genre standards, Yakuza 0 still hits far more than it misses and is a big, bold and bruising tour through the Japanese underworld.",1
"1551","MLB The Show 17 builds on last year’s version, which many cited as the best in the series, by adding some key features and improvements. Most notable are increased hit variety, MLB Network integration, and the RTTS documentary. All of these additions make the game feel more like real baseball. This authenticity makes games more fun to play, as it’s easier than ever to become invested in every pitch.",1
"1552","Destiny 2 is a blast out of the gate thanks to its excellent co-op shooter gameplay and strong storytelling in the campaign. Not all the features I’d expected to find are here, but it does deliver the same kind of highly social gameplay and rewarding, loot-driven progression that helped the original keep me hooked for hundreds of hours. The main concerns right now are a few bugs and lack of event options, but I’ll definitely be sticking around to see this big, action-packed universe develop over time.",1
"1553","StarCraft remains a titan of the genre for a reason. Though its interface lacks some contemporary conveniences, Blizzard has still, to this day, failed to outdo itself in terms of the elegant balance between three highly asymmetrical factions that was achieved in Brood War. Whether you want to revisit the glory days or see a piece of gaming history for the first time, StarCraft Remastered is a trip well worth taking.",1
"1554","It’s an epic journey that made me feel thrilled, devastated, and awed, and its tense moments had me tugging my collar both in and out of its fast-paced mystical sports arenas. With an emotionally charged ending that saw so much I’d striven for come to fruition, but was still tinged with tragedy and melancholy even when I did almost everything right, I won’t be able to get Pyre out of my head for a long time. This is Supergiant’s best work to date, and that’s saying something.",1
"1555","Accessible yet tough and grimy yet gorgeous, Dirt 4 sets a new standard in rally racing – and its well-considered career mode and endless stages inject it with tremendous stamina. Absolutely stonking brilliant.",1
"1556","Based on its colorful world, beautiful animation, and source material you might expect Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle to be “My first turn-based tactics game.” But you’re in for a surprise: even for XCOM vets some of its battles are challenging puzzles. Some of its tougher levels do devolve into a trial-and-error slog, but a good mix of enemies, objectives, and character abilities keep things interesting.",1
"1557","Project CARS 2 plays like a pumped-up version of the classic TOCA Race Driver 3 from 2006, redressing many of the complaints levelled at the original.",1
"1558","These upgraded versions not only have everything I enjoyed about Sun and Moon, but augments them in important ways by making small but meaningful changes to the story, expanding the selection of available Pokemon, and even making some small tweaks to the world. Unless you played through both Sun and Moon extensively and have already collected every Legendary Pokemon, it’s easy to recommend to any Pokemon fan.",1
"1559","Another epic-length episode of the humor that’s kept fans of the show laughing for 20 years.",1
"1560","Prey’s curious alternate-history universe, intriguing sidequests, hidden threats, and detailed environmental storytelling make Talos I a joy to explore. The unsettling sense of paranoia that comes from knowing any object could turn out to be a hidden enemy gives even the quiet moments a palpable tension. All of that picks up the slack for combat and stealth that doesn’t feel fresh enough to sustain it throughout what can be a long game.",1
"1561","Gorogoa crafts its inventive, sliding-tile puzzles and magical world with a graceful simplicity across a compact but fulfilling adventure. The excitement of solving each puzzle may be lost on a repeat playthrough, but its hand-drawn art and clever payoffs are no less satisfying to watch unfold again and again. Gorogoa manages to say so much without uttering a single word, endowing it with a mystery that invites a more attentive, thoughtful revisit — and one that I was more than happy to accept.",1
"1562","It was wonderfully satisfying to have more Dishonored to play, even if Death of the Outsider doesn’t quite meet the high bar Dishonored 2 set in story or mission design. Even though it’s a shorter and slightly shallower game, there are some exciting new abilities and interesting changes to the energy system, and the freedom from consequences of Chaos further encourage experimentation and freedom. All in all, it’s a worthy end to the story that began five years ago.",1
"1563","Despite the frustrations its upgrade system often caused me, I had a good time navigating Nex Machina’s array of twin-stick shooter challenges. The appealing art, energetic soundtrack, and pixel-perfect gamepad controls made me own every failure and look forward to whatever might come next.",1
"1564","Uncharted: The Lost Legacy succeeds on the strength of its characters, writing, and phenomenal depiction of India’s jungles and ruins. Being in the company of Chloe and Nadine keeps its overly familiar action sequences and disappointingly empty open-world area interesting, and it regains its footing in smart puzzles and thrilling cinematic moments.",1
"1565","You certainly get your $20’s worth out of Thimbleweed Park. The voice cast doesn’t elevate the script in the way they always did in the LucasArts “talky” days, but an enjoyable, self-referential story and hundreds of puzzles to solve make it worthy of a place on your shelf next to Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island.",1
"1566","These upgraded versions not only have everything I enjoyed about Sun and Moon, but augments them in important ways by making small but meaningful changes to the story, expanding the selection of available Pokemon, and even making some small tweaks to the world.

The voice cast doesn’t elevate the script in the way they always did in the LucasArts “talky” days, but an enjoyable, self-referential story and hundreds of puzzles to solve make it worthy of a place on your shelf next to Maniac Mansion and Monkey Island.",1
"1568","Now and then I’ll encounter a display quirk or a bug that may botch a race start, and the AI desperately needs a lesson in first corners, but when I’m out on track wringing ten-tenths out of my car against just the right AI level – one eye on the car ahead and the other on the clouds above – this is about as good as real racing gets right now.",1
"1569","Ultimately, FIFA 18 introduces enough new ideas to suggest it’s not sitting on the laurels of its success. However, it’s a simplified experience, one that fails to embrace the complexity of football at the highest level. Its focus on attack makes for spectacular matches, but they often feel like extravagant offensive training sessions than a proper match with depth and strategy.",1
"1570","The combat is challenging and thoughtful, and while the loot system doesn’t match up to games like Destiny 2, there are enough different weapon types and enough enemy variety to keep you swapping between weapons, catered to the situation. The RPG elements encourage challenges of their own, and even despite a handful of bugs, I desperately wanted to keep playing.",1
"1571","Whether playing online or off, there’s a huge amount to do here and a huge amount to love about it. Put the effort in and you’re repaid with a genuine sense of satisfaction and a feeling of real accomplishment. Once again, PES has set an incredibly high level of quality for other sports games to try and match.",1

"1573","The beautifully presented Puyo Puyo Tetris has a ton of content, a really fun multiplayer with a lot of variations, and is very easy to pick up and play with just about anyone despite the slight balance issues. The Nintendo Switch is a great platform for it too, with its portability and non-threatening Joy-Con controllers. This is the type of game that offers an adequate challenge for even the most hardcore puzzle players with its Challenge modes, but is inviting for even the smallest of children and gaming newbies.",1
"1574","There’s a lot to love in Nintendo’s second iteration of its quirky shooter, especially the way Splatoon 2 emphasizes splatting the ground just as much as it does inking your opponents. The new additions to its single-player campaign and multiplayer modes are a step in the right direction, but it still has some work to do to make joining online games and voice chat less of a hassle. Still, with an addicting new Salmon Run co-op mode and the promise of free updates like the ones that helped the original Splatoon come into its own, I expect Splatoon 2 to keep me hooked.",1
"1575","Xenoblade Chronicles 2 is a standout RPG that manages to keep its story, combat, and exploration interesting over the course of at least 70 hours of adventure through an impressively varied and rich world. Getting from place to place can be confusing, but outside of that and a multi-hour progression roadblock near the end this is an excellent game full of tough, memorable battles and a positive message.",1
"1576","An excellent addition to an amazing game. Developer Guerrilla has doubled down on the thrill of the hunt with more challenging machines and testing side quests that are added to the original map through an intriguing new storyline that delves into the mystical side of this post-apocalyptic world. It left me wanting start a brand new game, just to wander around the world, marveling at it.",1
"1577","Like Hide and Seek, Little Nightmares confidently captures the exhilarating fear of waiting to be found by something that’s hunting you. But it also replicates the alien horror of being a child that doesn’t understand what’s happening to and around them, and of a seemingly familiar environment turned into a series of opportunities for safety and danger. Smart, grotesque and never-endingly weird, this is a very different, extremely welcome kind of horror game that left me wanting more than its brief five hours provides.",1
"1578","Gorogoa crafts its inventive, sliding-tile puzzles and magical world with a graceful simplicity across a compact but fulfilling adventure. The excitement of solving each puzzle may be lost on a repeat playthrough, but its hand-drawn art and clever payoffs are no less satisfying to watch unfold again and again. Gorogoa manages to say so much without uttering a single word, endowing it with a mystery that invites a more attentive, thoughtful revisit — and one that I was more than happy to accept.",1
"1579","Steel Division: Normandy '44 succeeds both at being an entertaining real-time tactics game and a compelling simulation of historical combat, which is a remarkable combination. Not to get ahead of things, but playing this excellent World War II game makes it hard not to get excited about the potential of Steel Division: Stalingrad '42 or Rome '43. Future games or expansions might even smooth out Normandy ‘44’s small drawbacks, specifically its occasionally overwhelming amount of detail and lack of context to its huge number of options, but its successes wildly outweigh its failures.",1
"1580","Hand of Fate 2 doesn’t change much of the concept that made the first game so appealing, but everything here – whether it's challenges, smarter deck building, companion characters, and better combat – marks a major improvement over what we saw in 2015. Repetitiveness can still be a problem, but it takes much longer for it to show up. This time around, this is definitely a hand worth playing.",1
"1581","Dark Souls 3: The Ringed City has found a way to revisit the past without a cheap reliance on nostalgia, wrapping up the story of Dark Souls in a way that will be satisfying for fans who enjoy digging into the rich lore the series has been building for the last few years. But you don’t need an encyclopedic knowledge of the Souls series to appreciate the satisfying twists and turns of this short, but exciting adventure, with its abundance of haunting, secret-filled locales and terrifying boss fights.",1
"1582","Rockstar’s done a great job of retooling it to make LA Noire: The VR Case Files feel less like a port and more like something that was always meant to be played this way, and the effort shows.",1
"1583","The handling has been tuned to a T, the content is excellently curated, and the amount of variety and racing available in it is delightfully daunting. Even if you don’t care about the developer’s esports aspirations there’s still a mammoth solo racer here that’s always ready to roll whenever you are.",1
"1584","A great new story mode makes it at least a significant improvement, even if it’s more incremental than we’d hoped from a new game engine.",1

"1587","From the art to the music to the story to the tactical gameplay, and even to how they’re all woven together so artfully, Pyre is an adventure that excels in every area of its design other than limiting its multiplayer to local only.",1
"1588","The Evil Within 2 gives you more options to play your way in a much bigger survival-horror playground than the original. Although a disjointed plot and weak protagonist make it slow to get started, being pursued through an intriguingly bizarre world by plentiful and disturbing monsters kept my palms sweaty and my heart in my throat thanks to a strict adherence to the most important survival horror rule: you should always be on the back foot.",1
"1589","It was wonderfully satisfying to have more Dishonored to play, even if Death of the Outsider doesn’t quite meet the high bar Dishonored 2 set in story or mission design. Even though it’s a shorter and slightly shallower game, there are some exciting new abilities and interesting changes to the energy system, and the freedom from consequences of Chaos further encourage experimentation and freedom. All in all, it’s a worthy end to the story that began five years ago.",1
"1590","Microsoft pitched Forza Motorsport 7 as the ultimate automotive playset, and it’s hard to argue otherwise. With enough cars to fill a dozen museums and the most generous selection of tracks to date in the series, the amount of driving, experimenting, and racing here is absolutely mammoth. Accessible as always for beginners but crammed with content targeted at lifelong car junkies, Forza Motorsport 7 is Turn 10’s finest love letter to speed and style this generation, no matter what language you speak.",1
"1591","Tekken 7 truly is a hallmark, a fighting game crafted with obvious affection. It strikes a fine balance between accessibility to series newcomers and retaining much of its technical traditions. The soundtrack is an electronic treat, and while the story can at times seem a bit cliche, the fact that it never takes itself too seriously lets it bring in a tremendous amount of flexible character customization. Its dedication to the details helps push it into the position of my favorite fighting game of 2017 so far.",1
"1592","The shift to the Frostbite Engine definitely lets Madden NFL 18 look fantastic, and Longshot makes great use of that to tell a short but powerful against-all-odds story.",1
"1593","The Crimson Court pumps Darkest Dungeon full of disturbing blood-sucking enemies, a challenging new class, and a marathon-style new area that forces you to think differently about how to sustain your team over a long run. While there’s definitely enough new content in The Crimson Court to come back to Darkest Dungeon for, it’s more the kind of DLC that mixes things up for a new replay than an essential upgrade you should install from the beginning.",1
"1594","The turn-based combat may be a little disappointing, but Torment: Tides of Numenera manages to live up to the legacy of Planescape: Torment by offering a fascinatingly weird and well-written tale. Thanks to a wide variety of options in conversations and the influences of its tidal system, it offers decent opportunities for replay value and a memorable tale each time. This is the rare game that leans almost entirely on its setting and writing for its appeal, and the miraculous thing is that it usually succeeds.",1
"1595","A masterclass of atmosphere, storytelling, and the marriage of mechanical and conceptual design. While there are moments that feel shoehorned in to remind us we’re playing a videogame, the care and attention Ninja Theory has clearly poured into Senua and her story has created something amazing. This is a game everyone should play, and I’m thankful for the opportunity to have lived inside the mind of Senua, however briefly.",1
"1596","Ultimately, Danganronpa V3 doesn’t add too much new to the series. But that’s okay – it doesn’t need to reinvent the wheel when the wheel we already have still rolls out eclectic characters and shocking moments so reliably. It’s a great rollercoaster of hope and despair with a climax that made me sit back and think about everything that just happened. The road to the end of Danganronpa V3 is long and twisted, but the ride is well worth it.",1
"1597","That’s one of the best things about Fortnite: It always keeps things simple.",1
"1598","On the battlefield, Fire Emblem Echoes: Shades of Valentia is a delightful look into the simpler combat of Fire Emblem’s past. Elsewhere, it carefully guides the series forward into new territory. There’s not as much depth as I expect from this series, but whether I was exploring 3D forests and caves in a series first or learning first hand why Fire Emblem’s early entries are considered a formidable challenge, it was usually good old-fashioned fun.",1

"1600","Similar to the way Batman: Arkham City built on the foundation of Arkham Asylum, Middle-earth: Shadow of War is bigger and more ambitious in scope than Shadow of Mordor, with great results. The way it expands the Nemesis system with far greater variety and fortress sieges makes even better use of the stand-out generated characters, and its battles with memorable uruk captains remain challenging all the way through the campaign and into the clever asynchronous multiplayer beyond.",1
"1601","The beautifully presented Puyo Puyo Tetris has a ton of content, a really fun multiplayer with a lot of variations, and is very easy to pick up and play with just about anyone despite the slight balance issues.

The RPG elements encourage challenges of their own, and even despite a handful of bugs, I desperately wanted to keep playing.",1
"1603","Fast RMX may not be the perfect anti-gravity racing package, but it certainly offers high-speed racing and a lot of tracks to challenge yourself on. It’s a shame that the online multiplayer offering is so barebones, and that the time trial mode is currently AWOL, but in lieu of an official Wipeout or F-Zero this is a solid option to get your arcade racing fix on the Nintendo Switch.",0
"1604","Navigation and repetition of some of its simple puzzle mechanics drag a little, but it’s otherwise an excellent South Park game that’s also a strong RPG.",1
"1605","Ultimately, FIFA 18 introduces enough new ideas to suggest it’s not sitting on the laurels of its success. However, it’s a simplified experience, one that fails to embrace the complexity of football at the highest level. Its focus on attack makes for spectacular matches, but they often feel like extravagant offensive training sessions than a proper match with depth and strategy.",1

All in all, it’s a worthy end to the story that began five years ago.",1
"1607","A lot of games tout the ability to “play how you want to play,” but Sniper Elite 4’s missions and mechanics actually are robust enough to back up that claim. Picking apart the Nazi war machine piece by piece, using whatever plan comes to mind, is a blast. The way it encourages you to stay mindful, experiment, and get better is a refreshing vote of confidence, even if it doesn’t always reward the extra effort you’re putting in.",1
"1608","The Champions’ Ballad isn’t the extra dose of story for The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild that many fans were expecting, but it would be churlish to turn down another chunk of hours with one of gaming’s greatest achievements. Even better, those hours are filled with new surprises, endgame-level challenges, and the weirdest post-game reward of recent years.",1
"1609","Battle Chef Brigade successfully mixes genres to create something wholly engaging. The charming art direction and characters, creative combat, and clever puzzle mechanics help put Battle Chef Brigade squarely in its own genre. Despite a few storytelling stumbles and some minimal repetition, the sunny disposition of Trinket Studios’ puzzle/platformer/beat ‘em up ultimately shines through.",1
"1610","The Elder Scrolls: Legends may not be the most visually appealing CCG, but what it lacks in looks it makes up for in modes, mechanics and card design. This is well worth checking out for fans of The Elder Scrolls or digital card games in general. And like all great CCGs, the more you put into it, the more you’ll get out of it.",1
"1611","A beautiful and capable 4X game, with memorable personality that's seemingly calculated down to the pixel level. It doesn't deviate much from the genre's norms, but it delivers a generally satisfying 4X experience with only a few missteps in combat and diplomacy. Provided you're also okay with tackling a steep learning curve, it's also a satisfying entry point for the genre.",1
"1612","Another step forward on the court, improving on the series’ already great gameplay. You’re rewarded for smart, controlled basketball when dribbling, driving, and playing defense in ways that make sense for the players you’re controlling. In the side modes, results are mixed.",1
"1613","Solving every puzzle won’t take too long, but Snipperclips is continuously clever in its puzzle design and adorably fun to watch play. It left me eagerly waiting to reunite more frogs, put together more cat puzzles, and solve whatever other odd challenges developer SFB Games might have in mind.",1
"1614","Hand of Fate 2 doesn’t change much of the concept that made the first game so appealing, but everything here – whether it's challenges, smarter deck building, companion characters, and better combat – marks a major improvement over what we saw in 2015. Repetitiveness can still be a problem, but it takes much longer for it to show up. This time around, this is definitely a hand worth playing.",1
"1615","Yakuza Kiwami makes great strides in updating the classic original Yakuza game to modern standards. But while it adds better combat, bizarrely charming side quests, and a gorgeous graphical revamp, it also ignores some of the original’s biggest problems in pacing and storytelling. And because of its relatively short length, Yakuza Kiwami’s fun trip through the tangled web of Japan’s criminal underground feels like a prelude to something bigger and better to come.",1
"1616","While its antiquated roots cause some minor frustration with unreliable hitboxes and unnecessary grinding, the foundational combat and exploration is still engaging and fun after 30 years. From long-time Wonder Boy fans to platformer enthusiasts who’ve never heard of it until now, you’ll likely be able to find whimsical fun and a neat bit of genre history in this charming adventure.",0
"1617","Rime’s superficial beauty and interesting mysteries provided enough enjoyment to make me willing to put up with its shallow and familiar elements under the hood. While nothing about Rime is necessarily bad, you can find more interesting versions of nearly every single element of it in other, better games.",0
"1618","But it also results in the incredible visual and aural overhaul and the gameplay tweaks to earlier entries, like time trials and crate counters, that Naughty Dog added later in the series. Those additions make the overall package so much more cohesive while never forgetting what made, and what still makes, so much of Naughty Dog’s original trilogy a blast to play.",1
"1619","After a couple of story hiccups, Gravity Rush 2 righted itself and pulled me in with the personality of its world and wide variety of activities. The new gravity powers and styles make combat exciting, and well-written side quests and character relationships grant better insight into Kat’s universe. After 40 hours I found it hard to put the controller down, and I can’t wait to jump back in to finish every sidequest I can find.",1
"1620","Ultimately, Danganronpa V3 doesn’t add too much new to the series. But that’s okay – it doesn’t need to reinvent the wheel when the wheel we already have still rolls out eclectic characters and shocking moments so reliably. It’s a great rollercoaster of hope and despair with a climax that made me sit back and think about everything that just happened. The road to the end of Danganronpa V3 is long and twisted, but the ride is well worth it.",1
"1621","The amount of action that can transpire within a couple of seconds in Nidhogg 2 makes for two-player combat that’s both intense and hilarious to play or watch with friends. Nidhogg 2’s visual style might not be for everyone, but its sharp, minimalist duelling is still smart and chaotic enough to allow for endless couch competition.",1
"1622","Life is Strange: Before the Storm shows a lot of promise in its first few hours despite the same weaknesses in its script as the original Life is Strange series. The new talk-back mechanic fits Chloe’s character well, challenging you to roleplay as an angsty teen to get the best results. Everything is pointing towards a heartbreaking story with interesting characters, but the lack of finesse behind how it’s delivered and potential absence of impact from player choice give me some reservations.",1
"1623","Whether you’re crawling through the trenches in the campaign’s D-Day landing, fighting on the competitive battlefields, or lopping off gruesome undead soldiers’ heads in Nazi Zombies, Call of Duty: WW2 offers a surprisingly fast-paced and fun World War II experience.",1
"1624","Similar to the way Batman: Arkham City built on the foundation of Arkham Asylum, Middle-earth: Shadow of War is bigger and more ambitious in scope than Shadow of Mordor, with great results. The way it expands the Nemesis system with far greater variety and fortress sieges makes even better use of the stand-out generated characters, and its battles with memorable uruk captains remain challenging all the way through the campaign and into the clever asynchronous multiplayer beyond.",1
"1625","Another epic-length episode of the humor that’s kept fans of the show laughing for 20 years. The Marvel vs DC parody delivers regular laugh-out-loud moments with only a few faltering gags, and the combat soon evolves into something much more complex and interesting than The Stick of Truth’s simple system. Navigation and repetition of some of its simple puzzle mechanics drag a little, but it’s otherwise an excellent South Park game that’s also a strong RPG.",1
"1626","Pokkén Tournament DX serves as a definitive edition of Nintendo’s fighting game, and it fits well on the Switch aside from choppy split-screen multiplayer. Five new characters and a new three-on-three mode are noteworthy additions, though the new challenge mode doesn’t live up to its name.",1
"1627","Prey’s curious alternate-history universe, intriguing sidequests, hidden threats, and detailed environmental storytelling make Talos I a joy to explore. The unsettling sense of paranoia that comes from knowing any object could turn out to be a hidden enemy gives even the quiet moments a palpable tension. All of that picks up the slack for combat and stealth that doesn’t feel fresh enough to sustain it throughout what can be a long game.",1
"1628","For Honor has some dents in its shiny armor, such as the mediocre campaign, the frugal economy, and the snowballing victories in team modes. But it’s hard to be mad too long when I consider that the melee combat system is second to none and a joy to learn, take your licks, and then learn some more. I could feel myself becoming a better warrior with this deep, flexible, and complete fighting system. The more I play For Honor, the more I want to play For Honor.",1
"1629","Battle Chasers: Nightwars’ combat and activity-dense world scratch the JRPG itch, even if the storytelling and character development leave a fair bit to be desired. Its attractive dungeons and outdoor regions are fun to get lost in, and there are just enough hidden treasures to claim to make exploration rewarding in a more than visual capacity.",1
"1630","Tales of Berseria is a surprisingly strong showing for this long-running series. Its tragic story of broken people fighting on the wrong side of history makes it utterly compelling, and its well-tuned combat more than makes up for its lack of interesting environments. Simply put, this is a tale too heartbreaking to miss, or to forget.",1
"1631","The turn-based combat may be a little disappointing, but Torment: Tides of Numenera manages to live up to the legacy of Planescape: Torment by offering a fascinatingly weird and well-written tale.

This is the rare game that leans almost entirely on its setting and writing for its appeal, and the miraculous thing is that it usually succeeds.",1
"1632","Halo Wars 2 will scratch a real-time strategy itch and give you a dose of Halo-Universe flavor with a decent story, but it won’t go much deeper than that. A run-of-the-mill campaign, controls that hamper micromanagement, conspicuous bugs, and multiplayer that relies on luck limit its long-term appeal, but its fast and flashy action makes it fun for a while.",0
"1633","The most important parts of LA Noire have aged beautifully, with incredibly detailed faces, diverse characters, and unique, challenging crimes to solve as a detective. The top-notch writing and voice acting bring 1940s Los Angeles to life, but are let down by a dull open world with frequent frame rate drops. Aside from difficulty aiming in gun fights, it’s a smart port with accurate motion controls and the ability to play almost entirely touchscreen, too.",1
"1634","With a set of thieving and assassination tools that beg to be used creatively, Heat Signature’s puzzle-like missions are great for jumping into for a few goes at a time to try something just crazy enough to work. That’s when the fun stuff happens.",1
"1635","While its antiquated roots cause some minor frustration with unreliable hitboxes and unnecessary grinding, the foundational combat and exploration is still engaging and fun after 30 years.

"1637","Call of Duty: WW2 offers a surprisingly fast-paced and fun World War II experience. The campaign features a more personal story, while the new War multiplayer mode alleviates some of my frustrations with the generally small multiplayer maps. Of all the parts, though, Nazi Zombies is a standout with its wonderfully creepy setting and puzzle-like tasks. It’s mostly what you’d expect from a great Call of Duty game, and a near-miss for a spot in the lineup of top Call of Duty games.",1
"1638","I absolutely thoroughly enjoyed my more than 50 hours with Monster Hunter Stories so far. It effectively eliminates the oh-so-common boring RPG grind, implements a novel turn-based battle system, and sincerely surprises me with seemingly limitless customizability. Though wrapped in a pleasant, sugary coating, Monster Hunter Stories did all of this while retaining the spirit of the Monster Hunter world with some small yet enjoyable nods to fans. I can’t wait to dive back into the endgame and hatch myself a Kirin.",1
"1639","Golf Story's clever writing and sound golf fundamentals keep it entertaining, even through some stale moments. Despite its light-hearted RPG structure, there’s a challenging and very real golf game here that’s worth coming back to even after the story is over. But it left me wishing that more of the campaign focused on the golf itself, and less on the often repetitive side tasks.",1
"1640","Fallout 4 VR lets you experience the post-nuclear future in a much more intimate way. Its adaptation to the Vive’s hand-tracked Touch controls works fairly well for moving and shooting, but poorly for using the Pip Boy’s clunky interface, and that’s something you’ll need to do frequently. But it’s worth putting up with to come face to face with Fallout 4’s characters, monsters, and settings.",1
"1641","For Honor has some dents in its shiny armor, such as the mediocre campaign, the frugal economy, and the snowballing victories in team modes. But it’s hard to be mad too long when I consider that the melee combat system is second to none and a joy to learn, take your licks, and then learn some more. I could feel myself becoming a better warrior with this deep, flexible, and complete fighting system. The more I play For Honor, the more I want to play For Honor.",1
"1642","With three hits and three duds from Capcom/Disney years that you might remember with varying levels of fondness, the Disney Afternoon Collection is clearly aimed at children of the 90s. I have trouble seeing its appeal to anyone else. But if vintage duck-based platformers are your thing, grab a Capri Sun and a handful of Gushers and invite your friends over to play.",0
"1643","While it’s a shame that its dungeon dwelling enemies are far too easily exploited, Blaster Master Zero is ultimately an enjoyable reimagining of a largely overlooked 8-bit classic thanks to the rewarding exploration-focussed structure of its side-scrolling overworld. There are enough secret rooms and power-ups to seek out (including an additional ending), that I was compelled to scour every last inch over the course of my eight-hour completion time. It’s a good reboot; just not a Masterful one.",0
"1644","Mastering Fortnite Battle Royale’s many systems is worth every second of investment. Whether you go it alone or queue up with a squad, even if you’re the first to die or you actually manage to earn the Victory Royale, Fortnite’s zany style and unique blend of shooting and building almost never offers anything less than an outstanding time. It may not be the first battle royale game, and it certainly won’t be the last, but Fortnite sets itself apart from the crowd by giving you the freedom and tools to express your own personal playstyle.",1
"1645","With a properly meaty career mode, literally endless racing thanks to its procedurally generated stages, and the best sound and visuals Codemasters has ever mustered, Dirt 4 has redefined what we should expect from modern rally games.",1
"1646","If you’ve already played the original LEGO City Undercover on Wii U, then there is little reason to pick up this re-release. However, if you were one of the many who missed it the first time around then LEGO City Undercover remains a hilarious riff on police procedurals, built upon a GTA-for-juniors open world blueprint, and stuffed with enjoyable side missions and collectibles to hunt down.",1
"1647","The Master Trials doesn’t make any epochal changes to the established Breath of the Wild formula, but by packing in one of the game’s best quests, some welcome new features, and a hard mode to be reckoned with, it more than paves the way way for the starrier story expansion to come.",1
"1648","Like Hide and Seek, Little Nightmares confidently captures the exhilarating fear of waiting to be found by something that’s hunting you. But it also replicates the alien horror of being a child that doesn’t understand what’s happening to and around them, and of a seemingly familiar environment turned into a series of opportunities for safety and danger. Smart, grotesque and never-endingly weird, this is a very different, extremely welcome kind of horror game that left me wanting more than its brief five hours provides.",1
"1649","Star Trek: Bridge Crew feels like a promising first draft of a fantastic Trek simulator, but it only goes boldly for a few hours. After the novelty of finally sitting on a beautiful Federation starship bridge wears off and you’ve exhausted the handful of mission types, all that’s left is the goofy physical comedy of messing around with your friends or strangers in VR.",0
"1650","Graceful Explosion Machine builds an intense, addictive shoot-em-up around a satisfying weapon-juggling system and smart enemies. The Switch’s HD Rumble adds a unique feeling to every explosion in this colorful shooter, and earning a good spot on the leaderboard is an intense challenge thanks to dense swarms of enemies. But even when a pesky foe slapped down my scoring run, I always had the urge to jump back into these crowded corridors and try again.",1
"1651","Thankfully, whether you’re soaking in the cosmos around you, banking large sums of credits from a well-planned trading haul, or surviving a harrowing encounter with space pirates in dazzling ship-to-ship combat, Elite Dangerous has plenty to keep me excited to come back.",1
"1652","I can wholeheartedly recommend Bridge Constructor Portal as a rich, challenging puzzler with plenty of brain-twisters in store across its 60 levels. The pacing and methodical iteration it encourages meant it only ever taxed my mind, not my nerves. As a Portal fan’s nostalgia piece, it’s really not much better than a kitschy, amusement park gift shop recreation of the world many of us know and love – but the little nods serve well enough to enhance an already enjoyable puzzle game.",1
"1653","The storytelling and writing are taken to new heights, continuing a trend of improvement in each content release since Orsinium in 2015. The addition of the Warden class gives new and returning players alike a fresh and versatile way to play through the 25 hours of content. While the Warden’s bear companion skill disappoints and the Battlegrounds need work, what Morrowind does well has kept me enthralled in the world of Tamriel.",1
"1654","The addition of split-screen play, cursory in its execution as it may be, only makes the game more appealing to players who would prefer to experience LEGO City Undercover with a friend riding shotgun. And what's a good police story without a partner in crime-fighting?",1
"1655","Arms’ clever take on boxing provides a simple premise with a startling amount of depth for those who would seek to master the stretching appendages. Its rapidly evolving lobby system had me sticking around for “just one more match.” There may not be a lot worth unlocking right now, but planned free updates may just give Arms some additional legs.",1
"1656","Poochy & Yoshi’s Woolly World remains one of the cutest games around. Even though most of the tactile charm of the Wii U original has been lost to the 3DS’s technical limitations, there’s still plenty of fun to be uncovered in this colourful and often inventive platformer. Incidentally, it also brings some of the happiest, catchiest music ever to the 3DS.",0

"1658","Because of its diminished graphics and clumsy combat controls, Skyrim VR definitely isn’t the best way to actually play Skyrim. However, if you leave the difficulty on the default lowest setting and roam the world as a god who can slay enemies with the flick of the wrist, it’s a good way to experience Bethesda’s legendary RPG from a whole new perspective.",0
"1659","Every murder The Sexy Brutale includes is uniquely fascinating to investigate, with the central loop of searching for clues and executing a plan to alter time continually engaging. I found Boone’s quest so fascinating, the Brutale’s secrets so alluring, and its world so charming that I rewound the clock just to spend a few more days in Lafcadio’s beautiful nightmare.",1
"1660","A lot of games tout the ability to “play how you want to play,” but Sniper Elite 4’s missions and mechanics actually are robust enough to back up that claim. Picking apart the Nazi war machine piece by piece, using whatever plan comes to mind, is a blast. The way it encourages you to stay mindful, experiment, and get better is a refreshing vote of confidence, even if it doesn’t always reward the extra effort you’re putting in.",1
"1661","I'm glad that, in NHL 18, EA continues to seek out new players for the NHL series with smart upgrades to the training system and the exciting and accessible NHL Threes mode. Those are positive strides, but the rest of the modes and features are starting to feel too familiar. If you're someone who's been following the NHL series for years, you aren't getting anything drastically new here to alter the balance or restore excitement. The EASHL is still enjoyable with a great group of buddies, and the other offline modes are decent, but this series is in need of some new approaches to gameplay and refreshes of older modes.",0
"1662","Flashy and loaded with complex, micromanagement-heavy warfare. Its single-player campaign is long and challenging, but feels uninspired because it rarely makes creative use of the three factions’ abilities. In multiplayer it’s even more demanding and intimidatingly chaotic, but with only one mode and not a lot of maps, it seems limited. Relic deserves credit for not simply remaking the same game with prettier graphics, but this hybrid approach doesn’t feel as strong as Dawn of War 2’s memorable tactical focus.",1
"1663","Overcooked is one of the freshest couch co-op games I’ve ever played. It’s a perfect blend of strategy and chaos, asking you and your teammates to think on your feet as its smart and strange levels do everything they possibly can to make sure you are shouting at each other. The Switch port has some framerate and rumble issues that keep it from matching the best versions available, but for local multiplayer fun it’s hard to beat.",1
"1664","Mostly succeeds on two fronts: As a fresh way to revisit an old classic, and as the ideal entry point for players who haven’t yet smacked rival bikers with a two-by-four on the Mine Road or figured out the combination to Old Man Corley’s safe. There are a couple of sticking points for both old and new players, including some technical issues and (especially for the latter) that questionable “adventure game logic” which is anything but logical. Nevertheless, there’s never been a better time to hit the open road with Ben and his gang.",1
"1665","With three hits and three duds from Capcom/Disney years that you might remember with varying levels of fondness, the Disney Afternoon Collection is clearly aimed at children of the 90s. I have trouble seeing its appeal to anyone else. But if vintage duck-based platformers are your thing, grab a Capri Sun and a handful of Gushers and invite your friends over to play.",0
"1666","I wish I’d been given the chance to actually solve more of The Riddler’s puzzles on my own – adventure games are traditionally all about that, after all – but the tension and drama that permeate The Enemy Within’s first episode make it a winner. This strong start also leaves me very excited to see how John Doe’s inevitable transformation into The Joker plays out, and morbidly fascinated to see what scars this version of Gotham City will leave behind on its inhabitants.",1
"1667","The most far-reaching package of content in the franchise, stretching from the series’ earliest moments all the way to its most recent, but an understanding of its scope requires some history with Kingdom Hearts lore. And because much of it touches on familiar territory, as a whole it lacks an essential feeling that the main numbered entries and spinoffs (like Birth By Sleep) evoke.",1
"1668","In its best game modes, LawBreakers manages to make simply moving around feel amazing. Learning how to fall with style in the most deadly way possible is a thrilling challenge. Getting stuck playing a weak mode and map thanks to the grab-bag matchmaking can be frustrating, but it doesn’t ruin an otherwise fast and tense shooter that lets you gleefully propel yourself through low-gravity with rocket boots and miniguns.",1
"1669","Dragon Quest Heroes 2 feels like a step forward in some ways, but a step back in others. The new additions to combat are nice, but the attempts to bring more RPG elements to the story missions don’t always work out for the best – at worst, they wind up transforming an enjoyable action game into a boring slog. At least it shows that Omega Force is willing to try new things with their long-established formula.",1
"1670","Tacoma successfully overcomes the challenge of featuring eight characters and making them all interesting in a relatively short game. Using the out-of-sequence AR recordings to learn about the exciting events on Tacoma is a unique way to see every side of a conversation, and it’s one I hope to see catch on. I would have appreciated more time and events that'd have given me a reason to explore more of the beautiful station, but the time I did have in this fascinating hypothetical future was great.",1
"1671","The turn-based combat may be a little disappointing, but Torment: Tides of Numenera manages to live up to the legacy of Planescape: Torment by offering a fascinatingly weird and well-written tale. Thanks to a wide variety of options in conversations and the influences of its tidal system, it offers decent opportunities for replay value and a memorable tale each time. This is the rare game that leans almost entirely on its setting and writing for its appeal, and the miraculous thing is that it usually succeeds.",1
"1672","With three hits and three duds from Capcom/Disney years that you might remember with varying levels of fondness, the Disney Afternoon Collection is clearly aimed at children of the 90s.

"1673","Hob is a beautiful Zelda-like puzzler with fun combat elements that takes place on an enchanting world where nature and machinery alter the landscape as easily as a twist of a Rubik's cube. The wordless approach to the story creates some confusion and the fix camera sometimes results in unnecessary deaths, but never does the time spent with Hob feel wasted.",1
"1674","For Honor has some dents in its shiny armor, such as the mediocre campaign, the frugal economy, and the snowballing victories in team modes. But it’s hard to be mad too long when I consider that the melee combat system is second to none and a joy to learn, take your licks, and then learn some more. I could feel myself becoming a better warrior with this deep, flexible, and complete fighting system. The more I play For Honor, the more I want to play For Honor.",1
"1675","It’s no easy task, but Ever Oasis has managed to make me care as much about preserving my town as I do about saving the world. Despite the few odd design choices, there’s a wonderful blend of adventure and town-building where every task you tackle finds multiple ways to reward you.",1

"1677","This huge, wide-open shooter constantly shows its flaws in its mission variety and vehicle physics, but its strong, sandbox-style gameplay and seamless co-op kept me coming back for more madness. If you must repeat experiences over and over, you could far worse than helicopter chases, assassination missions, or drug busts gone wildly wrong.",1
"1678","Outlast 2 is a terrifying sequel that builds upon the scares of the 2013 original. Even if its ambitious themes don’t always land and navigating through its world can be frustratingly inconsistent, there’s more wicked creativity at play here than I’ve seen in a horror game in a long time. Play it loud, in the dark.",1
"1679","A great-looking remaster of a still fun, ridiculously over-the-top shooter from last generation that pokes fun at the genre while introducing its own distinctively violent, melee-heavy playstyle. On the other hand, it’s almost completely devoid of new content, which makes it less attractive for returning fans who were hoping for anything more than a facelift.",1
"1680","There’s never been a better time to hit the open road with Ben and his gang.",1
"1681","Mass Effect: Andromeda is an expansive action role-playing game with a few great moments that recapture the high points of the landmark trilogy that came before it, and energetic combat and fantastic sound effects create a potent sci-fi atmosphere. But without consistently strong writing or a breakout star in its cast to carry it through the long hours and empty spaces, disappointments like a lack of new races, no companion customization, and major performance problems and bugs take their toll.",1
"1682","When the bones hit the dirt, I’d rank the Necromancer highly in terms of sheer fun factor and uniqueness when compared to Diablo 3’s other classes. I do feel like $15 might be a bit much to simply unlock a new class, especially when so much of the new stuff in this patch (like some new areas for adventure mode) is being released for free. If it’s within your budget, though, I don’t think you’ll be disappointed with the new playstyles and crazy strategies Rise of the Necromancer brings to Sanctuary.",1
"1683","Virtual Rick-ality does a great job emulating the dark humor of the source material, even if it occasionally overindulges in its self-awareness.",1
"1684","Superhot VR’s fantastically clever time-manipulating concept empowers you with the superhuman reflexes of a slow-motion action hero. Shattering waves of glass-like enemies while moving your face out of the path of incoming bullets is a thrilling challenge in both the cryptic story mode and the endless mode that follows.",1
"1685","Similar to the way Batman: Arkham City built on the foundation of Arkham Asylum, Middle-earth: Shadow of War is bigger and more ambitious in scope than Shadow of Mordor, with great results. The way it expands the Nemesis system with far greater variety and fortress sieges makes even better use of the stand-out generated characters, and its battles with memorable uruk captains remain challenging all the way through the campaign and into the clever asynchronous multiplayer beyond.",1
"1686","Absolver is a beautiful martial-arts fighting game that allows for an impressive degree of personalized play with its innovative combat deck system, which lets you learn skills from combat with other players and NPCs. Unfortunately, it only comes with a single PvP arena mode at launch, and its fascinatingly nebulous campaign breaks off early and abruptly. It feels like an early access game with a ton of potential, but it’s not quite there yet.",1
"1687","In many ways, GT Sport is the most polished Gran Turismo game in over a decade. It looks great, feels great, and what’s here has been carefully and well executed. However, while I can forgive the sprinkling of eccentric nonsense, the lack of car and track content really hurts, and the online-only nature of the vast majority of it is worrying. Overall it just isn’t as complete as its key competitors.",1

"1689","Fighting my way through Ruiner felt like work, and if I weren’t obligated to finish it for the review I probably wouldn’t have bothered. It’s too bad it focuses on being difficult over being fun, because the combat totally works when you’re given access to the full range of weaponry and gadgets and can finally stand up to the nearly endless waves of varied enemies thrown at you. This one is definitely better the second time around. Games should be fun right from when you hit the start button – that’s kind of the whole point – but Ruiner puts you through too much of a hazing ritual to get there.",0
"1690","Star Trek: Bridge Crew feels like a promising first draft of a fantastic Trek simulator, but it only goes boldly for a few hours. After the novelty of finally sitting on a beautiful Federation starship bridge wears off and you’ve exhausted the handful of mission types, all that’s left is the goofy physical comedy of messing around with your friends or strangers in VR.",0
"1691","Bomber Crew is an exciting, in-depth management sim with a charming style that offsets the occasionally brutal difficulty of keeping your crew alive and trying to hit a target, all in real time. A rewarding upgrade cycle makes some trial-and-error frustration worthwhile, and once you get into the groove you can lose hours to its enjoyable rhythm.",1
"1692","The conclusion to Hell Is Empty didn’t give me my runaway future, but the prequel nature of Life Is Strange: Before The Storm made that an impossible dream. Instead, another story shoves it aside, trying to find the difference between what is right for someone and what is good for them, but there isn’t enough time in this episode to deliver this message and round out everything else. This pace leaves it rushed and somewhat tunnel-visioned. That said, characters I cared about and real, hard choices which often don’t feel truly right or wrong kept my gut firmly wrenched throughout. Light puzzles break up the talking and drama but again serve to remind us that correct isn’t necessarily right. Instead, there’s a strong single theme that’s delivered well in a story that isn’t afraid to get in a few punches.",1
"1693","Sundered takes the 2D Metroidvania platforming formula augments it with some successful ideas that all but reward you for dying. Its procedurally generated levels are hit and miss, as the dynamic parts come off as bland in comparison to Sundered's impressive hand-drawn areas and epic boss fights. In addition, its randomly appearing enemy hordes sometimes lead it to devolve into mere button mashing and random deaths, but the knowledge that I’ll come back a little stronger each time makes it hurt less.",1
"1694","Despite a lackluster ending to “Above the Law,” A New Frontier’s third episode kept me invested in Javi’s story, if not the plot as a whole. I’m a bit more wary heading into the latter half of the season after the jarring number of character entrances and exits in this episode, but if the strong character work continues, I’m more than willing to roll through the bumps of this mid-season episode. Telltale has found a sharp lens in Javi through which to analyze the ideas of family as bonds we’re forced into and choose to make ourselves. And he’s a lens, even in the season’s weakest moments, I still find myself wanting to help survive.",0
"1695","Since there's never any feeling of the grim spectre of Father Time looming large and there are enough random events to shake up the daily routine, doing my virtual chores in these charming and beautiful towns and unlocking a steady stream of rewards is relaxing, despite some annoyances with unnecessary travel and unskippable animations. And since the only requirement of Trio of Towns is to prove that farm life is a noble life, the pressure to succeed is never daunting.",1
"1696","Guardians of the Galaxy is definitely starting off on the right foot, with a great script, great actors, and a universe packed with personality (and backed by catchy tunes) to explore. If it can continue to deliver the quality of dialogue and panel-perfect action over the course of the rest of the season, it may find itself seated in the upper echelons of Telltale’s catalog. I just hope that now the series has introduced itself, the series gives its environments and characters just a bit more time to breathe in between speeding the plot along.",1
"1697","The Surge makes good use of its detailed sci-fi setting and provides an engaging experience throughout the 30 to 40-hour campaign, mostly thanks to its widely customizable inventory and wickedly fun combat system. It may struggle to keep the action moving and tell a strong story amid the chaos of battle, and its weapon progression plateaued early, but it offers some interesting ideas and delivers a solid new take on a familiar genre.",1
"1698","Balancing the objective-based main phase with the rushed and frantic giant monster-powered Rampage phase gives Gigantic a fast and distinctive pace that separates it from the MOBA crowd.",1
"1699","Slithering up simple structures in Snake Pass is one of the most mechanically satisfying video game ideas I’ve ever experience, and it effectively creates a sensation that feels the way maneuvering like a snake might. The camera and checkpoint systems aren’t great, but the concept still managed to hook me for the five hours it took wrap up the campaign. And in the end, I wanted to go back and replay stages to round up all the collectibles I missed.",0
"1700","The malleable quality of Fire Emblem’s weapons-triangle and pairing systems make them a natural fit for the hack n’ slash genre. Even when I could barely tell what was going on on the crowded battlefield and my troops were a little too codependent, I enjoyed directing the action and jumping in to be part of the carnage. And while Fire Emblem Warriors makes poor use of the Fire Emblem universe’s story and history, we still get traces of the relationships between the characters that make it memorable.",1
"1701","The fifth episode encompasses both what worked and didn’t about A New Frontier — namely, the ideas of allegiance, love, and family for the former and erratic pacing and an inability to make the overarching story of much interest in the latter. But the season finale spends much more time on those successful aspects, capping A New Frontier in satisfying fashion while setting up a potentially exciting continuation down the road.",1
"1702","Like an 80-overs old Dukes ball, Ashes Cricket may be a little rough around the seams. Yet it still manages to impress where it counts: out in the middle. There has never been a cricket game this approachable, fully-featured, or fun, and the inclusion of licensed Ashes squads and stadia is just the icing on what is already an exceedingly customisable cricket cake. With a bit more shine on it via future patches and community-created content it could be well and truly amazing, but even as it stands Ashes Cricket is the best videogame representation of the sport to date.",1
"1703","The Switch version of Resident Evil: Revelations 2 capably handles this entertaining horror experience. The frame rate is steady and the motion controls are mostly worth using. Load times can drag on, but they aren’t frequent enough to be a big issue. If you appreciate the thrill of sharing intimate zombie encounters with a friend, the ability to play this local co-op story with one Joy-Con a piece makes it a handy game to have on your Switch.",0
"1704","LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 doesn’t deviate much from the established LEGO template, but its wide variety of settings, heroes, and abilities make it constantly fun to play, especially in co-op. The combat is still quite simple and it’s sometimes difficult to tell what you should do next, but the story is lighthearted and fun enough that mild annoyances like these fade into the background.",1
"1705","The Surge makes good use of its detailed sci-fi setting and provides an engaging experience throughout the 30 to 40-hour campaign, mostly thanks to its widely customizable inventory and wickedly fun combat system.

"1706","Yooka-Laylee contains all the pieces needed for a fun, enjoyable throwback to the 3D collectathons of the 64-bit era. The characters are charming and funny, your set of abilities is vast and entertaining, and four out of five of the worlds are fun playgrounds to explore. While it lacks the heart and polish of some of its incredible predecessors, it’s a good reminder that this genre, once thought to be dead, still has some life left in it.",0

"1708","Call of Duty: WW2 offers a surprisingly fast-paced and fun World War II experience. The campaign features a more personal story, while the new War multiplayer mode alleviates some of my frustrations with the generally small multiplayer maps. Of all the parts, though, Nazi Zombies is a standout with its wonderfully creepy setting and puzzle-like tasks. It’s mostly what you’d expect from a great Call of Duty game, and a near-miss for a spot in the lineup of top Call of Duty games.",1
"1709","It presents an interesting world to explore but wastes its potential by recycling environments from early missions late in the game. Co-op mode is fun, too, but only selectively as some stealth-only missions seem far more manageable on one's own.",1

"1711","Matterfall succeeds in adapting Housemarque’s trademark style of fast, action-packed, arcadey action to the 2D platformer genre, but it feels like a puzzle half solved. There’s virtually no content here after you finish its exceptionally short campaign, outside of some harder difficulty modes and a global leaderboard to climb, and its level design isn’t well-suited for replay value. It’s a ton of fun while it lasts, but once it’s over it’s hard to not be left with a feeling of “Is that it?”",0
"1712","NBA Live 18’s simplistic and fluid mechanics make for an approachable game of NBA, or WNBA, basketball.

It’s great to just tap your Skylander on the right thumbstick, like you would with an Amiibo, and have it be recognized by the hardware in a matter of seconds. This is our first chance to play Skylanders on the go, and this takes the the idea of being able to bring your Imaginators to your friends’ houses to adventure together to a whole new level.",0

"1720","A very predictable update to a long-running series of dancing games that shines in visual design and unique choreography but is very loose with its tracking of your body movements. It’s not going to teach you to be a professional dancer, and it honestly doesn’t really teach you how to be good at Just Dance itself. That said, it’s still a whole lot of fun to play, and the songs that aren’t locked behind a paywall are varied and, largely, recognisable.",0
"1721","While Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite’s tag-team fights are like a bolt of lightning from Mjolnir, its story is dreadful and its characters look like they were deliberately designed to spawn a million derpy memes. It manages to be easily one of the worst and also one of the best fighting games in recent memory all at once. Like its heroes and villains, it’s stuck between two worlds.",1
"1722","Under Pressure transitions us off of the high-tempo radio hit that was the season opener and into a more relaxed slow jam punctuated with some meaty action riffs. The slower drip of meaningful events meant I didn’t come off of it with the same level of feel good euphoria I had after finishing Tangled Up in Blue, but Telltale is still doing an excellent job adapting this eccentric hero team to its tried-and-true format - particularly when the focus is on developing the characters and the relationships between them.",1
"1723","Especially next to the first Mega Man Legacy Collection’s six games and nicer save system, The Mega Man Legacy Collection 2’s package of four included games is ultimately a step backward. While the games are mostly good, none of them top Mega Man 2 or 3 -- and for the record, I think 3 is the best. 8, 9, and 10 are worth revisiting for a dose of retro platforming challenge, but know what you’re up against going in.",0
"1724","Doom VFR is a brave shooter that proves that VR games don’t have to be conservative with movement to work. Fast-paced action with a great stable of recognizable weapons and enemies makes it a challenging rush, once you find your VR legs. It’s a shame VFR story didn’t get the same self-aware treatment as Doom did, but even if it’s all about warping and gunning, that’s more than enough.",1
"1725","LEGO Worlds is commendable for its environmental diversity and the power of its creative tools to build anything you can dream of or manipulate every castle, hillside, and forest in sight. Unfortunately, fiddly menus, a pretty terrible combat system, and at times clunky and unfriendly construction controls weigh down on the wonder of finding and creating. Despite all this, I still find myself drawn back into it to discover what more the designers have hidden in the world-generation code, as coming across a massive ruined castle or an active volcano for the first time is always a treat - and an inspiration for what I want to build next.",0
"1726","“Thicker Than Water,” other than its satisfying ending, is the season’s weakest episode yet. Little that precedes the action-packed conclusion feels like it has much, if any, weight to the ongoing story I’m invested in — namely Javi’s life and his relationships with Kate, Clem, and David. I’m absolutely on the hook for the season finale after that strong start and thrilling ending — I just wish everything before it hadn’t felt so thin.",0
"1727","I can definitely feel that end-of-series crunch happening in Who Needs You, where all the many choices I’ve made have to converge back together to fit a limited number of endings. It comes across a bit heavy-handed in setting the stage for what seems like a somewhat predictable final chapter, but Telltale has surprised me before. As a standalone adventure, it’s definitely up there with Episode 1 as something I’d play over a couple more times, not just to explore different choices but because it’s simply fun and exciting. The fact that it pulls very few emotional punches left me feeling a bit worn out, but also with a glowing sense of anticipation for the sprint to the finish and tying it all together.",1

If I were to recommend one shooter to a PSVR owner, this would be it.",1

"1733","Despite the fact that this is a first-person VR adventure mostly devoid of the combat platforming that made the original Psychonauts so memorable, it still carries the same spirit. The wonderful writing and solid use of VR make it a fitting continuation to the series that left me pining for Psychonauts 2, especially when it ended after three hours and visiting just a handful of locations.",1
"1734","Mass Effect: Andromeda is an expansive action role-playing game with a few great moments that recapture the high points of the landmark trilogy that came before it, and energetic combat and fantastic sound effects create a potent sci-fi atmosphere. But without consistently strong writing or a breakout star in its cast to carry it through the long hours and empty spaces, disappointments like a lack of new races, no companion customization, and major performance problems and bugs take their toll.",1
"1735","When I’m having a good time in ARK, I’m having a really good time. The problem is that those moments are usually one part to every nine parts menial grinding and crafting - especially at the later tech tiers. Having to repeat so much work after failing an attempt at a boss feels far too punishing, and some really dumb dinosaurs can take a lot of the challenge and sense of danger out of the many primal locations. Even with all of those quirks, however, I’m still hungry to play more after the 60 hours I’ve spent so far.",1
"1736","Sundered takes the 2D Metroidvania platforming formula augments it with some successful ideas that all but reward you for dying. Its procedurally generated levels are hit and miss, as the dynamic parts come off as bland in comparison to Sundered's impressive hand-drawn areas and epic boss fights. In addition, its randomly appearing enemy hordes sometimes lead it to devolve into mere button mashing and random deaths, but the knowledge that I’ll come back a little stronger each time makes it hurt less.",1
"1737","Thanks to the imprecision of its shooting controls and the cheap behaviour of its AI, I could never really develop any confidence in Tokyo 42’s frustrating combat. Which is a shame because, glitches aside, I really loved exploring the wonderfully crafted world and the simple yet still challenging nature of its stealth-based assassinations.",0
"1738","WRC 7 doesn’t unseat Codemasters’ Dirt 4 as this year’s premier rally game, but it definitely continues Kylotonn’s upward trajectory in the genre. It lacks the classic cars that consistently appear in other rally games and the career quickly runs out of puff, but it’s well worth playing to attack its excellent courses – especially its monster Epic Stages.",0
"1739","Halo Wars 2 will scratch a real-time strategy itch and give you a dose of Halo-Universe flavor with a decent story, but it won’t go much deeper than that. A run-of-the-mill campaign, controls that hamper micromanagement, conspicuous bugs, and multiplayer that relies on luck limit its long-term appeal, but its fast and flashy action makes it fun for a while.",0
"1740","This huge, wide-open shooter constantly shows its flaws in its mission variety and vehicle physics, but its strong, sandbox-style gameplay and seamless co-op kept me coming back for more madness. If you must repeat experiences over and over, you could far worse than helicopter chases, assassination missions, or drug busts gone wildly wrong.",1
"1741","Road Redemption’s combat is a good but short-lived bit of manic fun, but it didn’t offer enough to keep me engaged through the majority of the 13 hours I put into it, and I’m honestly not sure if that would change even with the addition of more to do.",0

"1743","Guardians of the Galaxy is definitely starting off on the right foot, with a great script, great actors, and a universe packed with personality (and backed by catchy tunes) to explore. If it can continue to deliver the quality of dialogue and panel-perfect action over the course of the rest of the season, it may find itself seated in the upper echelons of Telltale’s catalog. I just hope that now the series has introduced itself, the series gives its environments and characters just a bit more time to breathe in between speeding the plot along.",1

"1745","Doom VFR is a brave shooter that proves that VR games don’t have to be conservative with movement to work. Fast-paced action with a great stable of recognizable weapons and enemies makes it a challenging rush, once you find your VR legs. It’s a shame VFR story didn’t get the same self-aware treatment as Doom did, but even if it’s all about warping and gunning, that’s more than enough.",1
"1746","The Signal From Tölva serves up a promising sci-fi concept, one that is made more intriguing by the ability to manipulate robot factions and some occasional awe-inspiring sights and sounds. But sometimes a slow burn can be a bit too slow thanks to its plodding movement speed, and that’s the case here. If you’re willing to wade through some deliberate pacing and lots of walking between repetitious shootouts with similar robot enemies, there are some intriguing bursts of action and sci-fi lore waiting for you on the hills of Tölva.",0
"1747","The pacing is spot-on, the combat satisfying and the gameplay varied. Co-op is genuinely good fun too, and most definitely the best way for younger gamers to get into the action. Knack 2 is definitely a step up from the original, then, but until the writing and characterisation improve drastically, it’s not going to be a true first party titan.",0

"1750","Underneath a forgettable campaign and unimpressive AI, Tiny Metal houses the seed of a really deep and entertaining multiplayer wargame. But until a head-to-head mode is added, it’s not much more than a set of unchallenging training scenarios broken up by far too much overwrought dialogue. I had plenty of fun with it, but didn’t get the kind of edge-of-my-seat decision-making moments that turned the tide of a difficult battle I could find in similar games.",0
"1751","A broad and goofy arsenal of unique weapons and gadgets and the ability to switch characters on the fly to access complementary abilities offers some solid combat and good mindless fun, but due to some unpolished writing and repetitive environments and enemy types, it doesn't fully live up to its heroic potential.",0
"1752","Sure, it could’ve done so with a bit more subtlety – it's a bit heavy-handed at the very end – but at least Black does have a point to make. It’s just a shame that it wrapped that in a game that’s so shamelessly and distractingly derivative.",0
"1753","Battlefront 2 does a lot of things right, offering a Star Wars experience that’s stunning to look at and wonderfully faithful to the source material, but it stumbles hard on the delivery. The campaign is amusing but scatterbrained, and worse, in multiplayer the randomized progression systems are downright hostile toward its players. EA has already made two big adjustments to this system in the week leading up to launch alone, and we can only hope that more significant changes are on the way. But right now, the Star Cards system’s frustrating progression is actively driving me away from the multiplayer battles.",0
"1754","The core of Episode 5: Don’t Stop Believin’ provides a thrilling and fulfilling resolution to the season arc with a couple interesting surprises in store. I just wish it hadn’t been immersed in this flimsy, fake crisis of the Guardians breaking up and getting back together that was never fully realized, and ended up dragging the whole season down.",0
"1755","Ultimately, FIFA 18 on Switch is a story of what could have been. Watered-down game modes give the whole experience a feeling of it being a work-in-progress rather than the complete package offered in the PS4 and Xbox One version. If you only want a quick FIFA fix in single-player or local play, the Switch version delivers. But it’s such a diluted, Sunday League experience it’s impossible to recommend if you’re already playing on home consoles.",0
"1756","When The Long Journey Home focuses on interactions with a diverse and entertaining cast of aliens across its procedurally generated star systems, it's possible to find a degree of wonder and personality that many roguelike seldom achieve. Unfortunately, such interactions take a back seat to a barrage of frustrating minigames with rewards that rarely match the risks. The experience as a whole suffers for it.",0
"1757","Under the better-than-ever graphics and great-as-ever core wrestling gameplay, WWE 2K18 is a largely disappointing iteration. It wastes too much of its ambition on the poorly written and dull MyCareer RPG mode, leaving its other promising modes to languish for another year.

Most of the problems are minor annoyances, but because save and menu bugs have been so frequent, this version of The Sims 4 is a generally unreliable experience, which is unfortunate since it is a genuinely fun game.

"1763","Berserk and the Band of the Hawk is mindlessly repetitive, but its combat is still somehow addictive enough to be an enjoyable action game with a dark-fantasy story that stays true to its source, most suitable for fans of Berserk. It even left me craving to try out new characters in Endless Abyss Mode. But it desperately needs more challenge and variety to carry it through its campaign, especially considering you can’t bring a friend with you.",0
"1764","Kylotonn has dredged this near-forgotten racing rebel from the very bottom of the barrel and fashioned it into a basic but fun, stunt-filled speedster, but I found myself regularly frustrated with its repetitive career mode, its stingy economy and nebulous unlockables, its superficial demolition derby events, and its uneven difficulty. A respectable franchise rescue mission but one that still needs some fine tuning and some extra grunt.",0

"1767","NBA Playgrounds isn’t as deep as NBA Street or as beautifully simple as NBA Jam, but the gameplay is still well paced and the controls are still tight. It mixes this gameplay with cartoonish qualities and a retro style that fits an arcade basketball game, and earning new packs of random players is always rewarding. That said, I’ve taken some bad beats from the random power-ups system, and the online options are slimmer than I’d like.",0
"1768","Mr. Shifty is an okay brawler that uses a stylish warping ability as a cool way to get the drop on unsuspecting foes.

"1771","When it works, Strafe is a generally entertaining retro-styled shooter that mixes procedurally generated levels into an experience strongly reminiscent of Quake. It's a great concept that usually comes together, but between the quirks of randomization, powerful enemies that run almost completely silent, lethal bugs, and hefty costs for vital armor and ammo powerups, a lot of the time it feels as challenging as rolling the dice and coming up with double sixes.",0

"1777","Urban Empire's premise of focusing on the political tumult that's usually behind city planning is a good one, and the emphasis on four families allows for some lightweight roleplay in how you guide your city to greatness.

"1778","When you’re playing as Jason, this is unquestionably the best Friday the 13th game ever made. I really appreciate the genuine love for the franchise on display here. Hunting down players and executing them in spectacularly gory scenes is an homage that warms my lifelong Friday-fan heart. But the fun of its asymmetrical multiplayer-only action is heavily skewed toward Jason, which means you’ll mostly be stuck playing as teens rummaging through drawers.",0
"1779","Curse of Osiris landed in Destiny 2 with a thud. Its campaign and story are a bust, its new content is mixed and buggy at best, and it does nothing to address the community’s loud cries for fixes to the endgame. The few redeeming features are its more challenging and varied Adventures, and the Raid Lair’s puzzles and tough boss battle.",0

The graphics are colorful and engaging, and the music is a pumping backdrop for extreme team-ups, super-speed cinematics, and lots of ruminations on the power of friendship. There are some really fun levels in the mix, too, and surprisingly strong boss fights make for some unexpected highlights.

"1789","Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3 is by no means a great game, though its value is raised by short and varied missions, fun action elements, and an ability to make me feel like a legit action hero. Regardless of how much it borrows from other games, I can’t deny that I had a good time blowing through missions and enemy troops. However, the poor graphics and technical issues like long loading times and crashes occasionally ruined the fun. And, minus any sort of multiplayer, there’s not a lot of reason to go back.",0
"1790","Valkyria Revolution tells a decent tale of war, but the strength of that story is dulled by overlong, boring, and poorly animated cutscenes.

"1791","Overall, I really like the theme and setting of RAID: WWII, especially considering its irreverent tone that evokes memories of Inglorious Basterds. But even though I’m a sucker for all things WWII, the bullet-spongy enemies, lackluster unlocks and customization, and poor mission variety don’t excite me enough to want to play beyond a few rounds. And while it’s putting the cart before the horse, without a strong community of users to drop into a raid with, there’s even less reason to stick it to Nazi Germany in this particular instance. Very little in RAID: WWII is absurdly broken or flawed, but its mediocrity makes it a missed opportunity to create a highly replayable co-op game within the WWII shooter genre.",0

With more mission variety, character development, and technical polish I could see this being an unexpectedly fun top-down shooter. As it is, its lack of ambition in scenario design makes too little use of its unique mechanic which, in itself, doesn’t always work the way you’d expect it to. Bloody Days also fails to really capture the feel of the movie on which it’s based, presenting iconic characters as cheap knock offs that spout their signature lines at odd moments like pull-string toys. While the shooting can be fun and challenging, this one’s definitely not worth losing an ear over.",0

"1796","I expected great action from God of War, and it delivers that handily. But I didn’t expect it to be a thrilling journey in which every aspect of it complements the others to form what is nothing short of a masterpiece. It’s a game in which Kratos, a previously one-note character, becomes a complex father, warrior, and monster, embattled both on the field and within his own heart about how to treat his son; one in which the world opens up and shifts, offering rewards in both gameplay and knowledge of its lore that I treasured with each accomplishment. The obvious care that went into crafting its world, characters, and gameplay delivers by far the most stirring and memorable game in the series.",1

"1824","The Wall Crawler’s open world doesn’t consistently deliver the thrilling moments of its main campaign, but the foundation laid here is undoubtedly a spectacular one.",1
"1825","This is a strange, complex game that – refreshingly – doesn't play quite like any other work in the genre. Iconoclasts offers a welcome reminder that they don't all have to play the same way.",1
"1826","Reroll gives a whole new generation the chance to experience this wonderful Japanese fever dream.",1
"1827","When you’re fully geared up and The Messenger is hitting you with brand new stages and challenges that you haven’t seen before, The Messenger is an amazing, must-play experience. Taken as a whole, it’s brought down only by fetch quests that make The Messenger last several hours longer than it feels like it should.",1
"1828","Donkey Kong: Tropical Freeze's addition of Funky Mode makes it more accessible without reducing the formidable platforming difficulty to a walk in the park. There's still a lot of challenge, even with the extra help Donkey’s Funky uncle affords. But the Switch version manages to take just enough of an edge off a punishing game to let the fun platforming outshine its difficulty.",1
"1829","As far as online play goes, my experience has been about 50/50. There were times when it was so smooth I might as well have been playing against someone right next to me. Other times, it was an infuriating lag-fest that would usually end with a disconnect.",1
"1830","This update not only has improved Destiny 2 for those buying the expansion, but also for all players, regardless of the version they own.",1
"1831","Civilization VI is as brilliant a 4X strategy game on Switch as it is on PC, tablets, or phones. With touch and Joy-Con controls that work reasonably well in both handheld and docked modes, I wouldn't be too upset about an even longer commute because it would give me more time to play a few turns.",1
"1832","Dragon Quest XI excels when it emphasizes fighting bad guys, exploring dungeons, and finding treasure. It’s a visual feast populated by a cast of colorful monsters more engrossing than its main characters. Uneven story beats and some icky bits sometimes slow Dragon Quest down, but superb mechanics remain the focus, making Echoes of an Elusive Age a top-tier JRPG for the modern age.",1
"1833","Black Ops 4’s rough edges do hold it back from an even better execution of its best moments, but when you’re not experiencing those technical issues, any of Black Ops 4’s three modes make for an enjoyable shooter experience that feel distinct and personalized.",1
"1834","Its storyline is gripping, its weapons-heavy fighting system accommodates no shortage of spectacle, and it serves up plenty of enjoyable side activities – both mini and macro – to divert to or return for after the story wraps. Yakuza 0 may still be the high watermark for the series on the PS4, but Yakuza Kiwami 2 isn’t too far behind.",1
"1835","Thronebreaker: The Witcher Tales is one of the best-written RPGs in years, with exciting card battles that are kept cleverly fresh throughout.",1
"1836","Its unique brand of tense, realistic shooting mixed with slow-paced tactical combat manages to stay fresh and exciting even after hundreds of matches.",1
"1837","Moss made a wonderful first impression and never let up. Spending four hours with Quill in this VR world was a joy, and no one element or environment type wears out its welcome. Its mix of combat and puzzles hooked me quickly, always kept things fresh, and left me wanting more.",1
"1838","Ni No Kuni 2: Revenant Kingdom distinguishes itself from its predecessor by layering fast-paced, real-time combat and an engaging kingdom building system atop more traditional RPG systems and quests. It’s a shame it delivers so few truly memorable characters and restricts so much of its storytelling to text on screen, but by the end of Ni No Kuni 2 the broader themes certainly resonate and the 40+ hour journey has been well worth it.",1

Now it’s not only brought back what made me love the first Destiny when it was at its best, but also added a ton of requests that fans – myself included – have wanted for years.",1

"1844","Despite some minor issues, the soul of Soulcalibur 6 is so strong that they don’t do much to bring down what is one of the best entries in the series. The new Reversal Edge and Soul Charge mechanics add new layers of strategy and mind games while the one-two punch of Libra of Soul and Soul Chronicle will provide hours upon hours of fantastic single-player content. Beyond that, Soulcalibur 6 is just straight up fun for players of any skill level.",1
"1845","The Missing: J.J. Macfield and the Island of Memories is an evocative, offbeat adventure with a sinister yet imaginative gameplay hook. Its story suffers slightly from subpar voice acting and an eagerness to tell more than show, but for the most part this is a dark, strange and utterly compelling journey into the tortured mind of its main character, and one absolutely well worth taking.",1

"1848","Hitman 2 doesn’t add much of note to the structure of its predecessor and thus feels more like Hitman 1.5 than a full-blown sequel. But that’s not a bad thing. By offering more of the deepest, fullest stealth sandboxes in gaming in one single package rather than six episodic ones, it earns its keep. The inclusion of Hitman (2016) is a bonus for those that didn’t catch the reboot initially. Here’s hoping they put more effort into the plot next time.",1
"1849","Gris is, at times, a meditative, affecting exploration of complex emotions that uses its levels as a canvas for some of the most beautiful visual design in any platformer, backed by a fantastic score. At others, it’s a maddeningly simple and confusing game that lets its artistic ambitions run roughshod over its gameplay.",0

"1851","While the campaign smartly doesn’t overstay its welcome — it took me about six hours to complete, including some distractions — collecting all 80 of Yoku’s hidden Wickerlings, finding all of its chests, and completing some other simple missions like delivering letters made me want to keep playing even after the credits rolled.",1
"1852","A big step outside of what we’re used to seeing from Assassin’s Creed Origins, and it pulls its whimsically mystical journey off well. Combat continues to be fun and challenging, and this time your biggest foes are fleshed out and varied enough to turn what could’ve easily been a monotonous series of fights into a highlight.",1
"1853","Two Point Hospital revitalizes the business management genre with flair, character, and enthusiasm. Easily understandable tips and icons make it relatively stress-free to get a working urgent care center running smoothly, while the potential for deep optimization through tweaking building layout and making wise hiring and training decisions leave plenty to munch on for the micromanagement lovers among us. If we’re on the verge of another classic genre renaissance, this is a great first foot forward.",1

"1855","Guacamelee 2 is a hilarious, challenging, and rewarding follow-up to Drinkbox’s original. It expands on the first’s ideas in so many great ways, and marries a complex but understandable set of moves to both its combat and platforming.",1
"1856","Valkyria Chronicles 4 is the sequel I’ve been waiting for, returning to the roots of what made the first game so special.",1
"1857","Dark Souls Remastered is a technically better version of an already-exceptional game. While the Switch version may lack some of the higher-end features available on other platforms, it still presents a more pristine version of the original, and importantly adds the exciting and absorbing dimension to explore Lordran on a portable device.",1

"1860","It’s a harrowing survival ordeal that knows how to play with tension and create the sense of a real world with complex inner workings and mysteries I was eager to discover.",1
"1861","A novel Metroidvania-pinball hybrid that stands out as something wholly unique. It blends those clashing genres with a beautiful island style, and its satisfying flippers and bumpers make uncovering its wide island a ton of fun. Retreading completed areas while hunting for secrets can occasionally get stale, but Yoku’s Island Express has a refreshingly positive attitude that kept me smiling the whole way through.",1
"1862","Yakuza 6: The Song of Life presents the most detailed virtual chunk of Japan the series has managed to date, and its story provides a satisfying end to the Kizama Kiryu saga. However, as far as gameplay goes, Yakuza 6 doesn’t make enough of an effort to break new ground, making it weaker overall than last year’s Yakuza Zero.",1
"1863","For many, basketball is more than just a game, and NBA 2K19 doesn’t take that lightly. It throws every resource it has into the theatrics of the sport, creating charismatic presentation, a well-written story mode, and strong core gameplay. The series’ persistent weaknesses are still apparent in areas like the transition game and ludicrous microtransactions, but there’s so much variety to how its extensive MyLeague mode plays out that there’s always a reason to look forward to the next game of basketball.",1
"1864","Octopath Traveler is a JRPG dream come true. Both its battle system and aesthetic pay loving tribute to the Super NES era while moving the formula forward in exciting and novel ways. This isn’t merely a modern retread of past classics, but a phenomenal homage with genuinely fresh ideas in a fantastically charming wrapper of old-school meets new. While the eight different character stories could’ve used a little more connection between them, I’m looking forward to going back to complete them all, explore the many side areas, battle optional bosses, and unlock the final job classes.",1
"1865","With a plethora of new modes and some significant gameplay tweaks that make ball control more convincing, FIFA 19 is a distinct improvement upon last year's effort.",1
"1866","It’s great to see Spyro’s return treated with such love and care, and I hope renewed interest in his past can light the way for his future.",1
"1867","Iconoclasts’ combination of clever Metroid-inspired design and lush art offers more than enough incentive to stick with it, even when the ambitious plot doesn’t always connect. This is a strange, complex game that – refreshingly – doesn't play quite like any other work in the genre. Iconoclasts offers a welcome reminder that they don't all have to play the same way.",1

"1873","I would have liked a little more incentive to explore the beautiful world Eidos Montreal has created, but I’d much prefer too much content than too little. There’s so much to enjoy elsewhere in a game that’s stuffed to the brim with ideas and devilishly challenging puzzles. I can’t wait to see where Lara goes next.",1

"1875","NHL 19 has something for everyone, packing tons of quality into its many fun and diverse modes.",1
"1876","Feels almost big enough to be a sequel to Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle rather than just an expansion, and it packs in a lot of tactical fun. Donkey Kong is literally a game-changing character with abilities that are fun to learn and use, and Cranky Kong’s alright, too. The main downside is that you’re locked into one team composition, which limits your ability to change up your playstyle or replay battles differently.",1
"1877","It adds a handful of new and interesting mechanics to its tactical battles, nearly all of which improve the formula in tangible ways, but otherwise plays it fairly safe.",1
"1878","You could call Salt and Sanctuary a 2D mashup of Dark Souls and Castlevania, and you'd be right. But such a simple pronouncement would be a disservice to the tremendous amount of thought that's gone into Salt and Sanctuary, whether it's in the graphic style that evokes horror through the style of comic strips or in the intricate web of dungeons and castles serves as it map.",1

"1880","Combat can be a bit of a chore once you find your footing, and the story ends all too quickly, but The Banner Saga 3 is a rich and powerful experience and a worthy end to a breakout trilogy.",1
"1881","The successful transition from exotic locales to America’s backyard makes me excited to see where the Far Cry formula goes next.",1
"1882","You shouldn’t buy PES 2019 for its new modes - there aren’t any of note. Nor should you buy it for major changes to existing modes - the ones made are minor. If you do opt in this year, it should be for the focus on player individuality that sets this iteration apart from all previous years.",1
"1883","Toys for Bob has done a great job of filling Spyro’s first three adventures with such reinvigorated life. Worlds a are packed to the brim with more detail, animations are consistently endearing, and the quality of life improvements make revisiting these once analog stick-less platformers a joy to play. They’re definitely easier thanks to some of those changes, but no less charming to play.",1
"1884","Octo Expansion throws plenty of both fun and serious challenges at you, between its expansive amount of levels and a multi-tiered finale that doesn’t disappoint. These trials provide worthy so many challenges for those who wish to hone their mechanical skills for upcoming multiplayer matches, that I wish this had been Splatoon 2’s base campaign all along.",1
"1885","The prospect of playing such a lovingly crafted tribute to the vintage heyday of Konami's seemingly abandoned Castlevania series more than makes up for a few out-of-place boss fights and a slightly too punitive death penalty. Bloodstained: Curse of the Moon delivers a brief but effective burst of nostalgia, and thanks to its many creative modifiers it contains enough replay value to engage (and challenge) anyone who pines for gaming's bygone days.",1
"1886","The strength of the MLB The Show series has always been its authentic gameplay, which traditionally does a fantastic job capturing the essence of baseball. The 2018 version of The Show continues that trend, creating the most realistic baseball game to date. However, the nuanced gameplay and visual changes don’t quite make up for the lack of innovation – or removal – of MLB The Show’s core modes.",1
"1887","A beautifully dark game, and I’m in love with its hard-hitting, meaty melee weapons. It’s a gorgeous game with tons of fun play styles and customization options to uncover, even if most of the loot you earn for your efforts is a letdown.",1
"1888","It's not revolutionary, but Mega Man 11 feels almost like a classic Mega Man game, and is a good foundation for the next 10 games.",1
"1889","Treasure Tracker still feels close to unique, and gains new life on both of Nintendo’s current systems. Switch is very much the better choice, but 3DS is by no means a bad option. Still smart, prettier than ever and, in retrospect, genuinely important as part of Nintendo’s modern history, Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker is a rare example of a game that actually feels better for being a few years old.",1
"1890","Ashen’s handful of new ideas make it a stellar Souls-like with solid combat, a great art style, and an interesting world.",1
"1891","An accurate physics engine generates realistic hits, and it keeps stats and models fatigue and morale in interesting ways. This realism is betrayed by a few control issues that affect the timing when batting and an AI that doesn’t always behave as you’d expect. However, the unique Ego system allows you to tweak the difficulty of batting and fielding individually until you find the perfect challenge.",1
"1892","It still works as a solo adventure, but is far more enjoyable if played with a partner. And despite its oh-so-cute appearance, the generous helping of brilliant Challenge levels attest that Unravel Two has really been made by a talented group of Scandinavian sadists.",1
"1893","Overcooked 2 serves up a great balance of hilarious chaos and strategy alongside meaningful improvements over its predecessor. The kitchens have more moving parts, the recipes are more varied, and the ability to throw ingredients fundamentally changes the arcade cooking formula. It’s still ideal when played on the couch with friends, but solo play is much improved, and online support adds versatility.",1

"1895","It only took me a couple of good sessions to play through everything Katamari Damacy Reroll had to offer, but the vast majority of those six or seven hours was spent with an enormous grin on my face, my head nodding along to the incredibly catchy, eclectic score. Katamari Damacy was a breath of fresh air on first release and it still is today, almost 15 years later.",1
"1896","Madden 19 returns the primary focus where it belongs: that moment-to-moment gameplay between the end zones. It’s only true stumbling point is the lackluster story mode that fails to recapture the magic of the first, but that's entirely offset by the new player handling that once again leverages the power of the Frostbite engine.",1
"1897","Though its social criticisms feel broad and rather clumsy so far, its core story of brotherhood and fraternity between two believable characters is already enormously touching.",1
"1898","Far Cry 5 is another wide-open playground with all the necessary ingredients for causing a real ruckus: loads of enemies and allies, temperamental wildlife, and plenty of explosions. Amidst all the insanity it manages to tell a serious story with respectable characters and a powerful ending, though it’s not the most memorable in the series.",1
"1899","Battlefield V is a grand and addictive shooter with some smart ideas for improving gunplay and team dynamics, but at launch it has too many technical issues and holes in its content to excel.",1
"1900","The first episode of choose-your-own-adventure drama Life is Strange 2 is an ambitious sequel that succeeds in its quietest moments.",1
"1901","Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate brings the majority of the series’ monsters into one package for a lengthy and exciting hunting extravaganza. While it feels dated in some ways post-Monster Hunter: World, it’s a great farewell tour for the old style of the franchise. If you can stomach the pacing problems and obtuse menu systems, it’s a worthwhile and challenging trek through the history of Monster Hunter.",1

"1905","Most importantly, Madden 19 has finally cracked that slightly repetitive feel that can make it tough to go on, game after game. With Real Player Motion delivering a fluid on-the-field experience, and Franchise mode customization offering another level of realism, Madden is in a great place.",1

Aside from its unsatisfying single-player mode and aggravating paywalled characters, it’s just the right blend of accessibility and depth, and one of the best entry points into fighting games you’ll find.",1
"1914","Ultimately Battle for Azeroth is a worthy if somewhat less ambitious successor to 2016’s Legion. the diverse new zones and more intimate storytelling alone make Battle for Azeroth an adventure worth diving into.",1
"1915","A net positive, though it leaves me awaiting the expected second expansion for Civilization 6’s true golden age.",1
"1916","If you go into A Way Out thinking its mandatory two-player co-op is a gimmick, you’ll likely come out of it realizing that it couldn’t have been done any other way. Vincent and Leo’s journey will have you and a friend performing tasks together both mundane and dramatic, and the result is a memorable, variety-packed cinematic adventure that feels like what Telltale’s games might’ve evolved into if they’d leaned into game mechanics instead of phasing them out.",1
"1917","BattleTech provides exciting strategic decisions and a compelling story, plus the slow-paced and meticulous fun of building up and customizing a mercenary company but suffers from the frustrating unpredictability of its weapons and procedural missions, and losing a favorite mechwarrior to a random head hit feels like it somewhat undermines the choices I’ve made along the way.",0
"1918","Though I wish its story had been handled with a softer touch, especially considering the subtlety that can be conveyed through its tech and performances, its well-written and acted central trio were vital enough to me that I found myself feeling genuine distress when they were in danger and a sense of victory when they triumphed. Most importantly, Detroit offers a multitude of transparent branching paths that entice further playthroughs, and choices have a permanence that raise the stakes throughout.",1
"1919","Insurgency: Sandstorm isn’t the prettiest shooter of 2018, but the places where it excels are the places that matter most. Its gunplay is superb, its arsenal is exemplary, and the maps and modes are serviceable enough to facilitate its memorably frantic and immersive FPS combat.",1
"1920","In changing the interplay between stealth and combat, Mutant Year Zero spins an interesting and intense new perspective on turn-based tactics that pushes you to get the most out of every move you make.",1
"1921","A Way Out’s finest moments come when it’s at its most cinematic.",1
"1922","Like the gaming equivalent of binge-watching a playlist of the funniest Vine videos, WarioWare Gold provides some enjoyable short attention span shenanigans, particularly for newcomers. But in the absence any substantial new additions and a paucity of worthwhile extras, WarioWare Gold is more like a runner-up silver for long term fans of the series.",0
"1923","The catchy song that plays over Pit People’s ending credits (and has been stuck in my head for the last several days) proclaims: And it all makes sense now! That might be overstating things, since its tactical battles never played out the way I expected due to each character having a mind of their own when it comes to what to actually attack or heal. But pit People’s weird world has a special, quirky way of being amusing no matter what you’re doing. I enjoyed it mostly in small doses, as the bright colors, twisted sense of humor, and goofy, energetic soundtrack can get to be a little much sometimes.",1
"1924","The Missing: J.J. Macfield and the Island of Memories is an evocative, offbeat adventure with a sinister yet imaginative gameplay hook. Its story suffers slightly from subpar voice acting and an eagerness to tell more than show, but for the most part this is a dark, strange and utterly compelling journey into the tortured mind of its main character, and one absolutely well worth taking.",1
"1925","Strong characters and environmental storytelling make The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit enjoyable overall. Despite the main objectives being underwhelming and the decisions seeming weightless, I became invested in the outcome of the story thanks to Chris’ lovable sense of wonder against a well-painted dreary backdrop. Captain Spirit makes me optimistic about what's to come in Life is Strange 2.",0
"1926","Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition is a good-quality port of the Wii U game, but outside of much more stable performance and better local co-op it doesn’t add enough new content to make replaying the story mode interesting again if you’ve already tried it. Luckily, the Adventure Mode maps and 16 of the 31 unlockable characters are available from the start.",1
"1927","With or without the unnecessary toys, Starlink: Battle for Atlas is a commendable space adventure. Even with the repetitive grind and randomly scattershot space combat, this is a great-looking, gratifying game of strategic action and environmental exploration. Switch owners are undoubtedly the winners, but there’s something here to enjoy on any platform.",0
"1928","The Missing: J.J. Macfield and the Island of Memories is a dark, strange and utterly compelling journey.",1
"1929","It’s mechanically repetitive no matter what planet you’re on, the dull combat should be avoided whenever possible, and bugs are plentiful. But buying new ships and building new things is enough motivation to make it entrancing – for a while, at least.",0
"1930","The 14 dated games included in the SNK 40th Anniversary Collection aren’t the stars of the show -- the care that was taken in dusting them off and presenting them is.",0

"1933","EA went back to the gym with UFC 3 to work on many of the weaknesses that had the previous two games struggling to find their footing. A fantastic new striking system and a much-improved career mode lead the charge, but UFC 3 is still hamstrung by a cumbersome ground game, weird collision issues, and the straight-up terrible Ultimate Team Mode. It’s still not a knockout, but Round 3 is UFC’s best yet.",1
"1934","More often than not, Ancestors Legacy showed me a good time watching my berserkers, Teutonic knights, and Slavic tribesmen hack their way through forests, marshes, and the occasional open field. The weakness in the core infantry combat, which tilts a bit too much away from quick, tactical thinking and into correctly guessing how the enemy line will be arranged, was the main issue that kept me from really coming to love it.",1
"1935","While its core story might not have the emotional punch of the original, Unravel Two improves upon the original in every other respect. The platforming is more responsive and demanding, while the puzzles are far more inventive and satisfying to solve, which is largely due to the excellent implementation of a second character and co-op. It still works as a solo adventure, but is far more enjoyable if played with a partner.",1
"1936","'What Ails You’ takes The Enemy Within’s biggest and boldest step yet toward redefining the Joker’s role in the Batman universe – should you choose to push him in that direction (which I did).

"1937","It may be a very short diversion, but Donut County is a delight. It’s absolutely brimming with personality, has a killer soundtrack and visual aesthetic, and is based on an irresistible gameplay hook. I’d have loved more, but I guess I’ll just settle for playing through it again.",1

"1941","Because of the Switch’s two modes, The World Ends With You: Final Remix is simultaneously a good port and a bad one. Using handheld mode and touchscreen controls, Final Remix holds up as a great JRPG with tons of depth. It packs all the flair and charm seen in the DS original, along with some new incentives to keep playing after the story wraps. But the moment you dock the Switch and try to use motion controls TWEWY becomes a pain to play, which eliminates the fun of the new cooperative mode.",1
"1942","BlazBlue Cross Tag Battle is like a jigsaw puzzle made of pieces from four entirely different sets, that by some miracle still manage to fit together to make a unique and mesmerizing tag fighting game. Aside from its unsatisfying single-player mode and aggravating paywalled characters, it’s just the right blend of accessibility and depth, and one of the best entry points into fighting games you’ll find.",1
"1943","The asynchronous multiplayer is unquestionably the star of the show, and queuing up multiple online games at once means you’re never stuck waiting for an opponent, and that you can play at your own pace. But while the new City Game story mode is conceptually interesting, in practice the largely scripted sequence of story missions doesn’t allow for much in the way of meaningful gameplay depth.",1
"1944","It still works as a solo adventure, but is far more enjoyable if played with a partner. And despite its oh-so-cute appearance, the generous helping of brilliant Challenge levels attest that Unravel Two has really been made by a talented group of Scandinavian sadists.",1
"1945","While some of the exposition-heavy conversations drone on longer than they should, it ends on a powerful note foreshadowing some difficult lessons Clementine has yet to learn about what it means to grow up and lead in a post-society world.",0
"1946","Super Mario Party delivers the couch multiplayer experience the series is famous for with an awesome new layer of strategy, 80 mostly-great minigames, and the quirky tech of the Switch controllers to keep things feeling fresh. The downside is that with the Switch’s controllers come some annoyances that make getting people settled onto your couch a bit more of a hassle than previous parties, and certain minigames are prone to annoying random upsets.",0
"1947","There’s a shining suit of mail underneath Kingdom Come: Deliverance’s authentically medieval grime. Strong characters and storytelling, one of my favorite first-person melee combat systems ever, and special attention given to building moment-to-moment immersion come together as a mighty alloy that ranks among the most unique, memorable RPGs I’ve played in years.",1
"1948","If you can stick it out through an unforgiving and poorly explained learning phase, there’s a lot of excitement, challenge, and customization to enjoy beneath and beyond the grand, glass habitation domes of Surviving Mars. I wish I’d had more reasons to care about the people in my colony than just the balance sheets for synthetic polymers and microchips, but at the end of the Martian day, it’s like a SimCity sandbox where everyone can die at any time because you made a minor miscalculation in your electrical grid. And that’s actually pretty exciting.",1
"1949","Black Cat's intro is great, but the first DLC episode feels more like a first act than satisfying, standalone content.",1
"1950","Artifact is a challenging, deep, and surprisingly approachable card game that breaks many of the conventions I’ve come to expect from the genre. That mechanical bliss is complemented by countless Easter eggs and detailed lore, but I am starting to miss a more meaningful progression system to keep me engaged long term. Its physical card game model has ended up being one of the more reasonable around, and the completely level playing field of Draft mode is so fun it’s worth the price of admission even if you don’t want to spend another cent.",1
"1951","It improves on a few areas historical Total War games have struggled with, but at the same time falls back into some bad, old habits that other games in the series were able to rise above. The overall tapestry reads as more than competent, and I could watch hardened huskarls with their massive axes crash into a Saxon shield wall all day. But there are too many blemishes for me to place it alongside some of its truly great peers like Attila and Warhammer.",1
"1952","Star Control: Origins does a great job of creating a new universe and stocking it with a diverse range of weird and funny aliens to fight in intense arcadey space battles. But everything you’re forced to do on a planet’s surface is boring at best and an annoying chore at worst, and that kills a lot of momentum.",0
"1953","With a story that manages to satisfactorily tread the line between high-concept fun and grounded character exploration, Shadow of the Tomb Raider meaningfully wraps up the journey Lara began in 2013 and convincingly leaves her in a place resembling where she was when we were first introduced to her more than 20 years ago.",1
"1954","While Strange Brigade can be frustrating at times, the charm of its 1930s world, the wonderfully exaggerated English alliteration of its narrator, and solid level design, combat encounters, and four-player co-op make it a strong, stylish third-person shooter.",1
"1955","Mario Tennis Aces is an extremely fun arcade tennis experience, colourful and dazzling to look at and smartly balanced in its back-and-forth play. With a little bit more care and depth given to the simple single-player mode and more variety added in the way of character and tournament customisation to give its multiplayer extra spice, Mario Tennis Aces could have been a true all-rounder. As it is, Mario Tennis Aces is still a lot of frantic tennis fun with friends.",1

"1957","Onrush managed to change the way I think about racing games.

"1960","I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked playing NBA Live 19. The core basketball game and its various modes offer plenty of chances to have a fun basketball experience. The new animation system makes action on the court look and act more realistic than ever, and a robust training mode gives plenty of opportunity to improve. Unfortunately, lifeless, canned commentary and little in the way of capturing the feel of basketball culture holds NBA Live 19 back. In the world of basketball games, it’s the Eastern Conference to 2K’s Western Conference – good, but at the end of the season, the odds are heavily in the opponent’s favor.",1

"1968","A lot of what The Hidden Ones gets right is its ability to take familiar concepts from Assassin’s Creed Origins and make them feel new again by means of a new purpose, a new story, and a new creed. A new direction to the story that makes Bayek more relatable, high-level combat keeps quests challenging even when you’re fully leveled up, and a more rewarding pace of loot provide an opportunity to feel something new without straying too far from what I loved about Origins in the first place.",1
"1969","The War Machine is an uneven DLC with a great new multiplayer map and Zombies chapter but unfortunate issues elsewhere.",0
"1970","Whether you’re adventuring through Dream Land with up to three friends or playing with competent AI teammates, Kirby’s ever-rotating group of uniquely powered pals are the real stars of the show here. The creative ways you can combine abilities never gets old, which means there’s great potential for replayability especially with friends. I just wish the final boss battle hadn’t come just as the puzzles were starting to give me a challenge.",1
"1971","Runner 3 is a fun, challenging experience with a weird, charming aesthetic brought down by out-of-date graphics. Playing the same level dozens of times wears thin, but its difficulty never feels unfair.",0

"1973","NBA 2K Playgrounds 2 adds depth to both the solo and multiplayer modes. Season mode improves the card collecting loop and Playgrounds Championship introduces ranked play for competitive users. The 2v2 basketball gameplay perhaps feels a bit too familiar but it’s refined in welcome ways. Pick-up-and-play arcade basketball is, thankfully, still alive and well.",1
"1974","The Space Marine campaign has some really cool ideas that help it not feel like you’re just hitting “Next Mission” over and over. It’s just a bummer that the controls get in the way of me being able to truly dive in and enjoy it, like having to eat a really nice Thanksgiving pie with just a spatula.",1
"1975","Pathfinder: Kingmaker delivers a fantastic story and a deep character system to dive into. Without a Dungeon Master on the player’s side to smooth out the rough edges however, its balance is wildly inconsistent and its event design, flawed. So many promising ideas fall well short in execution.",0
"1976","Last Year: The Nightmare is among the best the asymmetrical survival-horror genre has to offer so far. While it’s light on content and has some severe bugs, the rewarding class-based gameplay and great killer diversity makes each match feel slightly different and equally exciting.",0
"1977","Its platforming is okay but unimaginative, and its best ideas, like the tree jumping and singing affecting the world, remain underused. It can be a beautiful game at times, especially with regards to its music and audio design, but not so much so that it hides its rougher edges and undeveloped concepts.",0
"1978","A great get for those who may have missed it the first time around, or anyone who might want to revisit (and re-destroy) the red planet. It may not add any new content to address the empty open world and bland story, but it does perform well, and everything I loved about Red Faction: Guerrilla is still front and center and looking better than ever.",1

"1982","Even with dated graphics, EDF 5 is an energetic essay on action game design that is way too much fun to miss – especially with friends.",1
"1983","Hours of Darkness is a clever and fun but brief twist on the Far Cry formula. Its new approach to Guns for Hire AI companions gives you something other than yourself to worry about during battles, and its use of perks as a reward for stealth kills encourages my favorite style of play in an interesting way, but can bring your momentum to a screeching halt when you slip up.",0
"1984","Borderlands 2 VR sacrifices co-op, but returning to Pandora from this closer perspective is still a largely fun shoot and loot experience when played with the DualShock 4.",0

"1986","The Resistance DLC adds needed map variety to multiplayer and introduces another fun Nazi Zombies map. The tighter, dense map Valkyrie gives the new Resistance Division a chance to shine with plenty of close combat opportunities, while Anthropoid offers snipers space to work their magic.",1
"1987","Rogue felt like a throwback when it was originally released alongside the next-gen Assassin's Creed Unity. This same feeling accompanies this remastered version. After the significant advancements made to the series by last year's Origins, Rogue second outing feels equally dated and mistimed. Ironically for the series, Rogue Remastered proves that going back in time isn't always fun.",0
"1988","The Bard's Tale 4: Barrows Deep is a rousing but technically rough adventure driven by great music, clever puzzles, and challenging turn-based combat.",1
"1989","While it didn’t wow me as a competitor to Endless Legend or Civ 6 in the 4X race, there’s a lot of action-saturated, tactically-driven fun to be had when you look at Gladius - Relics of war for what it truly is: a really well-done, turn-based 40K wargame. It’s one of the best turn-based 40K games I’ve played through that lens.",1
"1990","A very blunt attempt to fuse two beloved games, Dark Souls and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, into one challenging 2D action-platformer. Developer White Rabbit shows a strong understanding of what made each of them great but glosses over fundamentals that all great games need, such as responsive controls and an understandable game world, and falls short of its promise.",0
"1991","Detective Pikachu offers a bold take on the iconic Pokemon, which succeeds thanks to Pika Prompts that build Pikachu beyond detective stereotypes. Even though I figured out cases far before their end, each one utilized the world of Pokemon to its fullest, and ultimately offered a unique Pokemon experience that I hope we see done again soon.",1
"1992","H1Z1 checks all of the boxes needed to be a competent battle royale game, but in its main mode it lacks a distinctive sense of character. Without the realistic depth and modular weaponry of PUBG or the wacky base-building antics of Fortnite, its streamlined design rushes toward straightforward, fast-paced action instead and ends up being dull as often as it is exciting. The more interesting thing about H1Z1 is its innovative Auto Royale mode, which translates battle royale mechanics to vehicular combat in a way we haven’t seen done better elsewhere.",0
"1993","Below is a gorgeous, atmospheric dungeon crawler that is difficult to take in at the pace it deserves because of oppressive survival mechanics.",0
"1994","With or without the unnecessary toys, Starlink: Battle for Atlas is a commendable space adventure. Even with the repetitive grind and randomly scattershot space combat, this is a great-looking, gratifying game of strategic action and environmental exploration. Switch owners are undoubtedly the winners, but there’s something here to enjoy on any platform.",0
"1995","Overall, compared to its competitors Fable Fortune is lacking polish and some basic features, and its gameplay is a little more linear. But it does have The Dog and all the other characters and humour that made Fable special, and that makes it a fun way to dive back into a treasured series.",0
"1996","The straightforward simplicity of Darksiders III is a refreshing change of pace after exploring so many dense open-world games. That simplicity doesn’t refer to the combat or boss battles, though, which are complex and almost startlingly unforgiving. Its throwback philosophy is comfort food for action gamers of a certain age, but it would’ve been nice to see the third game in the series introduce some new concepts to relaunch Darksiders in the modern age.",0
"1997","A grey second act that ultimately sets us up nicely for a far brighter finale.",0
"1998","Fe is a short-lived platformer that still manages to outstay its welcome in some regards. Its platforming is okay but unimaginative, and its best ideas, like the tree jumping and singing affecting the world, remain underused. It can be a beautiful game at times, especially with regards to its music and audio design, but not so much so that it hides its rougher edges and undeveloped concepts.",0
"1999","Vampyr is a slow burn of an RPG, taking its time to ramp up its intriguing blend of science and the supernatural in an elaborately gloomy version of London. When it gets going you can see the potential of the way it offers you more power if you consume its interesting citizens. But Vampyr never commits to this idea to the point where I felt I needed to make that sacrifice to succeed in its relatively simple combat, which leaves it feeling toothless and vulnerable to having a lot of its fun sucked away by technical issues, despite its genuinely engaging story.",0
"2000","Below simply leans too hard on roguelike and crafting elements, which create an urgent pace and conflict with its more admirable design ideas.",0
"2001","Its platforming is okay but unimaginative, and its best ideas, like the tree jumping and singing affecting the world, remain underused.

"2003","With a breezy pace and a comically weird story, Little Dragons Café is a unique take on farming sims. While I loved cooking meals, establishing my inn, and the anxiety-free pace, its management mechanics have been watered down just a bit too much and result in stakes so low that much of it becomes meaningless. Without making important decisions or a wealth of more interesting side-quests to capture my attention, I eventually ended up bored by the repetitive tasks.",0
"2004","As it stands at launch, it’s genuinely good fun with friends, but progressing to Pirate Legend is a long grind. Sea of Thieves needs a lot more briny depth before it’s the amazing voyage we’d hoped for, but so far the great cooperative moments are a good start.",0
"2005","For competitive players who want a mix of survival and crafting, Rust is the best there is; for everyone else, there are plenty of other games.",0
"2006","The Crew 2 is big, confident, and stuffed with arcade racing action – land, sea, and air. There’s undoubtedly something still charming about a racing game that lets us drive an F1 car across the Golden Gate bridge, fly a Spitfire through the Grand Canyon, and crash a monster truck through Central Park, but its uneven presentation, lack of events that use its best features, and absent PvP is a bummer.",0
"2007","To be very clear: State of Decay 2 bugs out early and bugs out often.",1
"2008","Rather than surprising with clever twists and spending time developing a core set of characters, Episode 2 continues a path of sticking to a tired, formulaic layout in which characters, decisions, and moments are seemingly swapped out to lead to predictable moments and outcomes.",0
"2009","The straightforward simplicity of Darksiders III is a refreshing change of pace after exploring so many dense open-world games.

"2010","Conan Exiles captures the brutality of the source material, but weak combat and grindy crafting make it an often slow and arduous survival game.",0
"2011","Even if it falls short of becoming a worthy successor to the likes of Chrono Trigger, Lost Sphear really does capture the essence of classic role-playing games in a lot of ways. When it's not bogging itself down in overwrought mechanics, this RPG really can spark a sense of nostalgia. Its writing, environments, battle system, and music all evoke the best moments of bygone days. And even if it doesn't quite hit the heights it aspires to, it does a fine job of rekindling some fond memories.",0
"2012","Danger Zone 2 is exactly what I wanted the first Danger Zone to be: the true follow-up to Burnout’s classic Crash mode that EA won’t give me. It’s not as fully fleshed out or polished as my dream game of this type would be, but as a self-contained and one-note smash-up it shines like a spectacular fireball explosion. Now how about reviving the rest of Burnout? Road Rage mode, anyone?",1
"2013","FromSoftware’s foray into VR is as fascinating for its storytelling ambitions as it is disappointing in its overly familiar gameplay.",1
"2014","The thing that pulled me through Strange Brigade’s campaign and had me tackling the extra horde and score attack modes, though, is its sense of style.",1
"2015","ntuitive, authentic, and surprisingly realistic, Killing Floor: Incursion emphasizes the physical dimension of its virtual world, delighting in the tactile qualities of VR and making the most every little object. Whether you’re staring down the scope of a remarkably believable sniper rifle or clobbering enemies with the dismembered arm of one of their own fallen comrades, you never fail to have a clear, satisfying sense of how every item, weapon or body part feels.",1
"2016","There’s definitely fun to be had with My Hero One’s Justice. It’s super easy to pick up and play, the action is fast and beautiful to look at, and it does a great job of adapting the quirks and abilities from the anime to a 3D arena fighter. That fun eventually starts to fade away due to shallow combat and a weak story mode, but overall, it’s not a bad first endeavor.",0
"2017","Just Cause 4 is a slightly better version of Just Cause 3's destruction-fueled action, but lacks a big new idea to give it an identity of its own.",1
"2018","It’s a competent and occasionally pretty pick-up-and-play arcade racing game at its core, but it has the whiff of a game released in the wrong era – a scent it just can’t shake.",0
"2019","The stories told of its misfit characters are bleak, witty, tense, and ready to shine a light on their flaws. And yet, like the devilish, grinning masks the populace has donned in conformity, you can’t help but notice what’s just below the surface.",0
"2020","Warhammer 40,000: Inquisitor - Martyr gets a lot of things right, but drops the ball where it matters most for an action RPG. We’re left with a repetitive, not very tactically exciting combat system and itemization that arbitrarily forces you to gear for item level rather than better stats. Everything else is just a nice house built on a shaky foundation at that point. Even the Emperor can’t protect this clumsy shoot-em-up from its own sins.",0
"2021","Call of Cthulhu is a dark ride through a mad, cosmic horror nightmare with a paranormal detective story as your vehicle. Occasionally poor level and encounter design can make the eerily atmospheric road a little bumpy, but the engaging mystery and an intriguing utilization of RPG mechanics make it one of the more enjoyable Lovecraftian games in years.",1
"2022","Even those who consider themselves Final Fantasy completionists aren’t going to have enough story content to keep them playing for long. That’s frustrating, because when its various parts all come together in harmony it is a fun, unique team fighting game.",0
"2023","What’s here is an amazing foundation for a social experience that’s beautifully realized , and that makes it frustrating that its gameplay loop is so repetitive and its progression is so stagnant.",0
"2024","State of Decay 2’s zombie-infested maps are good places to scavenge, fight, and survive in. Combat is satisfyingly brutal and the special zombies inspire some real fear of permanent death, even though the Blood Plague turns out to be more of a sniffle. But the bugs are just as persistent as the zombies, and after a dozen or so hours the repetition of both eventually take their toll, making the appeal of replaying feel more limited than I’d expected for a sandbox RPG.",1
"2025","The lack of multiplayer, missing alternate game modes, and emptiness of ancient China left me far from satisfied.",0
"2026","Pokemon Quest can be a cute little distraction when taken in bite-sized pieces, but it’s best served with a lot of patience. It’s cute, and its systems are much deeper than they seem, but trying to build my perfect team definitely drove me a little crazy.",0
"2027","Although survival and crafting are fairly manageable, running through randomly generated towns, streets, or abandoned fields unfortunately shows that We Happy Few can’t hide from the ghost of its own past, no matter how much Joy you take.",0

"2030","Though its achievements feel very incremental, Sinner: Sacrifice for Redemption moves the Soulslike genre forward in some interesting ways. The slimmed down structure presents some challenging and entertaining boss fights, but doesn’t quite feel like a complete package. It lacks narrative and aesthetic detail, but there are a few clever new ideas hidden inside its generic shell.",0

"2033","Secret of Mana HD Remaster is a bit of an odd duck. For every one thing it does to enhance the original, it makes a strange, distracting change or doesn’t make an obvious fix. Still, even as I waffled between loving it for its happy colors and lovable cast and feeling frustrated by its fussy AI and uneven difficulty, I always felt a childlike wonder at its relentless charm. Warts and all, this classic RPG remains a treat to pick up and play.",1
"2034","It’s functional and fun enough in small bursts, but arcade racers have come a long way over the past two decades and Gravel doesn’t bring any new ideas to the paddock.",0

"2036","Fatal Bullet isn’t a bad game, but it didn’t hold my interest for very long. It’s fun to be surrounded by familiar faces from the anime series, and I could see glimmers of depth in Fatal Bullet’s combat and upgrade systems. However, the poor story pacing and the repetitive nature of exploration dragged it down. While it’s a good change of pace for games based on SAO, it still lacks the polish needed to really stand out.",0
"2037","Parts of Earthfall present a certain charm, and the co-op shooting experience could certainly be fun with the right group of friends. But it’s hard to get away from the fact that Earthfall is a lesser incarnation of a decade-old game, with fewer modes and missions, at a higher price.",0
"2038","Lost On Mars is a strange choice for a Far Cry 5 expansion, and this risky change of scenery doesn’t pay off. While it does feature a hilarious fan-favorite character, I just wish the gameplay was as inventive as the dialogue and gun nomenclature. It’s too bad Ubisoft couldn’t find a way to make an alien world feel more interesting than the Montana countryside. Even with the addition of a jetpack, lasers, and alien bugs this planet feels dull as red dirt.",0
"2039","Survive might not compare well to the tactical espionage action that’s defined the Metal Gear series we know and love, but its oddly hit-or-miss combo of some solid old ideas and some clumsy new ones has at least some appeal.",0

"2046","Past Cure never does anything special. Every time it tries to do something interesting, it immediately forgets about it and does something else. Don’t get me wrong: it’s not a bad thing to include a number of genres within one game. In fact, it can help keep it fresh if they serve as a breather from a strong central idea. The problem is that Past Cure has no strong central idea to take a break from or return to. Whether it’s the initially compelling yet convoluted supernatural story or the interesting gimmicks that never leave the tech demo phase, it’s a disorganized bundle of ideas that are never given a chance to develop into something out of the ordinary.",0

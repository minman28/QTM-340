"1","Despite the disappointing multiplayer options, the clichéd characters, and the sometimes repetitious nature of the campaign, the strategy gameplay of Shadow Wars is fun enough to make it a worthy recommendation for any turn-based enthusiast.",1
"2","Prejudice certainly does a lot – it just doesn't do very much well.",1
"3","While the timer on my save read around 14 hours by the time I screamed and shouted and pushed my way through Two Worlds II's final (miserable, cheap, and poorly designed) boss encounter, I would put my play time in the neighborhood of 35 hours, at least. This is courtesy of Two Worlds II's propensity to greet exploration with quick, brutal death.",1
"4","The[] ability to tear apart and repair the environments at will is a hook that keeps working, and when the campaign gives you plenty of stuff to tear apart it's easy to lose yourself to a primal need to destroy.",1
"5","It's funny, it clever, and it answers a lot of questions I had. I enjoyed playing it, but I didn't love it. The story isn't as grounded as I'd like it to be at certain points, so it throws the balance of sincere/goofy off. I wanted the conclusion of the serious movie feelings episode one started, but I got the comical ending of a Saturday morning cartoon.",1
"6","For a game that tries so hard to get under your skin, Fable III rarely manages to do much more than scratch the surface.",1
"7","Through questionable level design, graphical inconsistency, and repetitive gameplay, I was pulled out of the experience more than I would have liked. Alice: Madness Returns is a memorable peek through a flawed looking glass.",1
"8","With a level-headed team of four, Magicka's cooperative action is entrancing chaos. It's rare for a game to feel this mechanically satisfying.",1
"9","Serious Sam 3: BFE will ultimately exhaust its players by virtue of its screen-filling mega-confrontations, its non-stop repetition and the sense that you are almost always mercilessly outgunned. Sam 3 is good but could have been better.",1
"10","DCUO is far from a bad game; there are indeed times when it shines fantastically with the potential for greatness, but its many faults, most minor but some quite large, ensure that it never reaches those heights.",1
"11","A dungeon crawler with a boring loot table, poorly implemented multiplayer, and little lasting incentive to continue running around the world once the tedious story ends.",1
"12","I'm a fan of games that give you control of your character's life (see: buying houses, decorating, pimping sweet rides), but the driving is missing the raw energy it needs to stay interesting and the rest of the experience is bug-ridden.",1
"13","There's something kind of addictive about teaching your fake dog new tricks. For repeat customers, unless your kid is still playing the first game religiously, I don't see the upgraded version holding their interest for nearly as long.",1
"14","There's something kind of addictive about teaching your fake dog new tricks. For repeat customers, unless your kid is still playing the first game religiously, I don't see the upgraded version holding their interest for nearly as long.",1
"15","There's something kind of addictive about teaching your fake dog new tricks. For repeat customers, unless your kid is still playing the first game religiously, I don't see the upgraded version holding their interest for nearly as long.",1
"16","It's just disappointing that the developers only added a handful of mostly inconsequential extra modes in the interim, and didn't take that extra time available to fix a few of the first versions' flaws.",1
"17","For its effective use of 3D gameplay and its simple yet refined design, PilotWings deserves a good deal of credit.",1
"18","There's a lot of talking and gathering things for other people. It's rather ho-hum.",1
"19","Caught somewhere between massively-multiplayer online role-playing game and hardcore competitive real-time strategy, Age of Empires Online delivers some of the most addictive parts of both. Some sloppy mechanics and balance and reward issues detract from the core Age of Empires experience, but not to the point that it's not worth playing.",1
"20","Sanctum nicely upgrades Tower Defense genre but unfortunately doesn't dig much fun out of a good idea. [Issue#204]",1
"21","The lack of feedback, in-game competition, and unpredictability hurt the game's long-term draw; some older business simulations didn't have these problems. Cities in Motion does feature stellar tools and is one of the prettier business simulations on the market.",1
"22","An online shooter needs variety, depth, and addictiveness to succeed over the long term. Brink might find a niche with some hardcore fans, but it isn't for everyone. The PC version feels more complete than its console counterpart, but my qualms over content remain the same. Brink has heart, but the overall package is lacking.",1
"23","The majority of the new features introduced in The Sims 3: Generations are enjoyable enough to fiddle with, but none of them are major game changers.",1
"24","The content of Dead Money can get frustrating quickly. Still, for the patient souls out there, this fresh spin on Fallout is a decent buy.",1
"25","Sequence is sort of like serving someone a ham sandwich on a silver tray with all sorts of accoutrements. It's nice that it's a silver tray and not a paper plate, but I'm still eating a ham sandwich here.",1
"26","Homefront is certainly one of the most unique shooters I've ever played, driven by an ingenious and surprisingly well-fleshed out plot and a dark and dreary, realistic setting. But it also controls and feels like a typical shooter, looks like a game that's several years old, and most importantly, has an inexcusably brief campaign.",1
"27","Q.U.B.E. offers some short-term fun for puzzle fans and not a lot else. With so little emphasis put on story I can't help but feel that Q.U.B.E. may have benefitted from having no story elements at all, instead of loosely hinting at some bigger picture that goes unseen.",1
"28","Delivers an interesting and fun variation of a traditional card game and turns it into a competitive puzzle with myriad nuances to its strategy. Unfortunately, it doesn't do enough to keep the variation fresh throughout.",1
"29","And so it is that Freakyforms still leaves me scratching my head, even five months later. You're welcome to try it for yourself to see if you have better luck at understanding its madness, but I'd recommend most 3DS owners save the seven bucks to spend on surer bets.",1
"30","TwinBee is sort of fun and funny as it is.",1
"31","It's far from a perfect game -- inconsistent AI, a campaign that borders on the short side, and limited multiplayer options certainly hamper the experience -- but there's a lot of challenging satisfaction to be found beneath the thick jungle canopy.",1
"32","It all leaves me wondering why, at this point, anyone would choose to spend money on Play4Free when they could essentially get a larger, more complete game for just a few bucks more than the minimum Battlefunds purchase price.",1
"33","The flawed story mode can be safely passed by, but if you're able to find an opponent online or skirmish against the AI it's easier to appreciate Oil Rush's strengths.",1
"34","A surprisingly rich title for a handheld console. It's perfect for a quick game on tiresome commutes.",1
"35","I know a mediocre expansion when I see one, and this is a truly mediocre expansion, one not worth your money. Hold off until the price comes down or EA releases some sort of The Sims Medieval Gold Edition.",1
"36","In an age where everything is capable of online play, it just doesn't make sense for a franchise famous for its cooperative play to be single player only. Still, it'd be a great distraction for kids, who are less likely to be annoyed by the repetitive level design.",1
"37","Whereas the console version of Sonic Generations is a blending of old and new mentality in a fast-paced speed fest, the 3DS version is mostly just a Sonic Rush game where both playable characters happen to be Sonic.",1
"38","While it's admirable that the team had opted to create an original story set alongside the events in the books, you'll wish that they had attempted to take more risks with the project. The characters are bland and lifeless, and the combat, while fun at first, gets pretty repetitive before too long.",1
"39","It's like an interactive coloring book made by a 10 year old obsessed with Mastodon.",1
"40","A fun but deceptively shallow Sim-RPG-thing that would have benefitted from pushing the envelope for either genre a little more.",1
"41","The vast amount of customization options and the simple but fun battle system kept me interested enough to overlook the poor execution of story.",1
"42","Despite its considerable flaws, at its core, Mercenaries is a ton of fun. From the moment I started playing it I couldn't put it down.",1
"43","Cargo! The Quest for Gravity could have been an unforgettable game title; unfortunately, due to poorly-conceived vehicle controls, unclear objectives and some serious technical issues, what's bound to stick in your mind is the frustration of playing it.",1
"44","Sure, it's not very deep from an RPG-elements perspective, nor does it have the kind of story that's going to make you go ""Hm!"", but it will entertain you and help whet your appetite for the monster-stomping extravaganza that will be Serious Sam 3.",1
"45","The performance and control issues make Continuum Shift II a very disappointing package. If you're more interested in single-player, you might be able to tolerate the slowdown and enjoy BlazBlue's finer points, but I could only recommend doing so if you literally have no other options.",0
"46","Purchasing Arrival means there's more to do in Mass Effect 2, and that's always a good thing. It sets up the tone of urgency that's prevalent in the Mass Effect 3 trailer, but don't expect it to explain a lot. If you don't mind combat-focused, linear missions, it's worth the $7.",1
"47","Chantelise could have been a tight little RPG were it better balanced and not so keenly intent on punishing the player. With more grind than game, it quickly devolves into a pointless, repetitive drill that would test the patience of all but the most determined gamer.",1
"48","For the price it's not bad for being a multiplayer-only title, it's just that nothing about Breach is particularly noteworthy.",1
"49","The entire time I was playing, I felt ripped off. I'd been suckered into thinking I would be getting something new and dazzling and instead, I ran into the same problems I had 11years ago. Don't bother with this rehash on 3DS.",1
"50","It's odd blend of cover-based shooting, a fantasy setting, and hot co-op action make it an eyebrow-raiser, but the execution is flawed.",1
"51","E.Y.E. is an ambitious game from a small team, and has moments where it shines, but it ultimately isn't all that fun.",1
"52","If you don't expect much from it, you'll have a pretty good time with Venetica. However, without the patience to figure out quests and gameplay elements on your own, you'll end up incredibly frustrated.",1
"53","Innovative and somewhat unique but ultimately repetitive to the point of boredom and at times just plain annoying, Off-Road Drive, as it stands, simply isn't a good game.",1
"54","There's one hell of a game in there, trying to escape. And I think, given the responsiveness and the past track record of the development team and the plans that lie ahead in the next few months, that escape will soon occur.",1
"55","A $40 asking price for Pac-Man & Galaga Dimensions is far too high for such a mediocre collection.",1
"56","At this point, InMomentum isn't really worth its asking price. While its limited, nostalgia-tinged take on platform racing gets the entertainment wheels turning, its repetitive game modes and at times awkward mechanics prevent it from ever getting up to speed.",1
"57","F1 experts have probably already been racing their way through the home console versions of this title since September. With the 3DS version's odd A.I., it's hard to recommend that Formula fans give this edition a go. Codemasters knows racing -- but when they pass off portable development to other teams, you've got to be wary.",1
"58","The massive character customization also makes your faery or elf feel unique, so if you enjoy leveling up and finding loot, you should check out Faery: Legends of Avalon.",1
"59","Well executed, but lacking in depth (which is ironic for a multitude of reasons). However, once you give it a fair shot, you'll be surprised how addictive the gameplay is and how much fun you'll have trying to master the controls and conquer each mission.",1
"60","There is the skeleton of a good game in here: a multiplayer-focused Smash Bros clone starring Cartoon Network characters. But it's just too buried under poor controls and a mediocre single player campaign to achieve fun status.",0
"61","The First Templar is not good. Maybe with a bigger team, more time or a bigger budget this could have become something worthwhile, but it feels like an unpolished knock off.",0
"62","Aside from its uninspired combat and limited scope, Pirates of Black Cove is an endearing game at times. I wanted to love it, and kept diving back in hoping that something would click. It didn't.",1
"63","If simple fun and the inclusion of Pokemon is all you're looking for, then Rumble Blast is the game for you. Otherwise, there are much more deserving 3DS titles to spend your hard-earned cash on.",1
"64","Thor 3DS still offers a passable brawler for fans of the genre at its most basic, but if you're looking for the next great portable game, you best look elsewhere.",1
"65","With subpar platforming and boring level design, Rabbids is only fit for easily distracted youngsters or adults looking to throw away $40.",0
"66","An aesthetically gorgeous game with a really interesting premise that just never finds its legs.",1
"67","It's a muddled, hypocritical exercise in irritation with solid shooting mechanics and decent encounter design. There's some dumb fun to be had in Duke Nukem Forever, but the game tries hard to ensure it's only fleeting.",1
"68","I wouldn't call Jurassic Park a bad game as it works and does take us back to a time when dinosaurs (stiffly) roamed the Earth, but the story, animations and general gameplay keep it from being able to contend with most titles on the market -- and that includes other Telltale titles.",1
"69","Injecting dynamic time travel into a real-time strategy game is a risky, ambitious move. Though it takes a lot of effort, experimentation, and agonizing in order to use the time travel mechanics effectively, Hazardous Software manages to pull it off. The problem is the rest of the game suffers from design flaws and technical issues, making Achron feel like an RTS relic.",1
"70","A Game of Thrones: Genesis's sluggish campaign further suffers from poor pacing, and the end game almost always devolves into ham-fisted warfare punctuated by dull combat – one of its weakest facets.",1
"71","Despite its many shortcomings, Splinter Cell 3D is still fun to play. And that's what matters most. It's not even close to being as good as Chaos Theory on Xbox, but then again, I couldn't play that on a plane. If the AI were even passable and not laughable, this would be an easier recommendation.",1
"72","If a game's multiplayer mechanics are strong enough to support it, story isn't necessarily a must-have. Here however, awkward mechanics and skewed difficulty ultimately hamstring The Haunted: Hells Reach, and make you wish there was something more to hold it up.",1
"73","Cubic Ninja could have been an amazingly addictive game, but some faulty controls and a lack of content hold it back. It's still a fun experience, but for such a high price tag it's not really worth the investment.",1
"74","A poor change of pace for the franchise. Taking the story into modern times seems to have robbed it of its passion and charm, replacing it with asinine characters and more cuss words than an Al Pacino flick.",0
"75","Captain America fans should only buy this game if they're willing to put up with clunky gameplay and mediocre presentation.",1
"76","It's a step down from Shattered Dimensions, offering a less interesting plot, fewer Spider-Men to play as, and less fan service. As a finished product it just feels rushed.",1
"77","You need a clear, unified vision to shape a game into something that makes sense and compels the player to see it through to the end But scares and gameplay in Afterfall fall flat as scene after scene repeat the same notes, turning what could have been a spine-chilling adventure into a treadmill to an unsatisfying finish.",0
"78","The current game is broken, buggy, and not very fun. The plans for the future of Gods & Heroes are noble, but the core game needs to be reworked first and that could take far longer than it's worth.",0
"79","Killing the first few zombies in the tutorial level alone shows the violence and tactical planning that could have made the game something special. As you progress however, all the bugs, all the inconsistent controls, all the unbalanced gameplay, and the awful checkpoint system completely ruin the experience.",0
"80","The story is where the game had an advantage, but unfortunately it drops the ball with the weird narration, lack of dialogue, and limited cutscenes.",1
"81","I was most disturbed by the game's complete lack of multiplayer functionality, and the inexcusable state of its season mode, the two things that are the biggest draws in today's Madden franchise. It should go without saying that you should pass on this rushed iteration of Madden.",1
"82","While 1C Company should be congratulated for being ambitious enough to put forth the effort to recreate in minute detail, one of the most pivotal events of the Cold War, they should perhaps be admonished for not being ambitious enough.",1
"83","Bust-A-Move Universe has some serious negative sides (like being way too short and having no multiplayer), but the core gameplay is as solid as ever.",1
"84","Passion alone isn't enough to make a game great. Stronghold 3 assumes too much of the user initially, and doesn't do enough to keep the village-building fresh and interesting.",1
"85","There are many other 4X games on the market that do basically everything SotS2 intended, but better and without the bugs.",0
"86","I love the concept for Combat of Giants: Dinosaurs. It's brilliant. I wish the game lived up to that though. More varied gameplay, a longer career that got challenging, and multiplayer are all sorely missing.",1
"87","For the most part, the game is just boring with lackluster gameplay and reused environments, and then it gets frustrating. Toss in issues I didn't even mention such as unresponsive weapons and repetitive music, and I know I wouldn't want to suit up for this one.",0
"88","Truly horrible.",0
"89","The game lacks variety, but it also doesn't outstay its welcome. If you want some laughs and don't mind that the shooting experience is average at best, playing through this alien invasion is probably more entertaining than the movie and you'll get some Achievements/Trophies out of it.",1
"90","Skip over 3D Classics: Urban Champion. Urban Champion is not a classic, it never was, and 3D is entirely wasted on it.",0
"91","A ho-hum action game that despite its bang and bluster fails even to achieve mediocrity. It promises what looks like an interesting stealth/shooter mechanic but never lives up to it, settling instead for an approach that's linear and predictably formulaic.",0
"92","It is remarkable in its ability to make five minutes seem like five hours. Pickings might be slim on both the Wii and 3DS this summer, but Transformers Stealth Force Edition isn't diversion. It's abuse.",0
"93","It's hard to imagine anyone not being offended by Postal III. That's a big selling point for some folks, but the uninspired gameplay and serious technical glitches all but kill this dark, occasionally humorous, and extreme exercise in freedom of expression.",1
"94","For us, it's all about the sweet science, and in this regard SFxT is still sorely lacking.",1
"95","Something of an uncanny experience. A lot of the experience remains intact but its vitality has been drained away. It's a muted affair, and that ultimately harms a game that derives so much of its charm from those little touches.",1
"96","It's good, chaotic fun and has a baseline level of quality and polish that's pleasing to see. If this is your first Wipeout game, chances are you'll have a blast. For veterans, however – especially those schooled in the delights of HD and Fury – this game just isn't as smooth in feel or as elegant in design.",1
"97","Little Inferno looks nice, tells a unique story and will perhaps be seen by some as a triumph in experimental design. But it's not really a video game, so feel free to forget this freaky fireplace.",1
"98","So Fluidity: Spin Cycle feels like a hardware/gameplay mismatch on the 3DS, and the awkwardness of its controls keep it from ranking as one of the portable eShop's best purchases.",1
"99","ZombiU has so many great ideas from looting with the Wii U GamePad to permadeath to its spooky setting, but none of them grow into a great game. Controls are clunky, melee combat is annoying, and the game doesn't look good.",1
"100","Tera's an action-MMO that nails the ""action"" part and then manages a face-palm-inducing face-plant on all the other bits.",1
"101","There's still plenty of life in the genre, as this creative romp amply demonstrates, even if fully appreciating it takes more patience than some will be able to muster.",1
"102","Has a nice, colorful approach to golf and a respectable set of multiplayer options. But the disconnect between the amount of time required to plan a shot and the milliseconds needed to mess it all up sparks ample frustrations.",1
"103","Lilli's cute flavor of insanity makes her an intriguing character to play as, but she can't carry the plot of Harvey's New Eyes alone. The rest of the cast is so underdeveloped, the environments you explore so banal and uninteresting looking, that it's hard to appreciate Lilli's character or the smart puzzle design.",1
"104","It's impressive that Namco-Bandai has managed to port a full-sized, voice-acted Japanese RPG to the 3DS without sacrificing any of the content from the PlayStation 2 version. But it's also a six-year-old game that hasn't aged well in all respects, and if you're a North American Tales fan, it's likely to be one you've played before.",1
"105","It's hard to deny the value of buying a pool game on Vita and getting its PlayStation 3 counterpart as an added bonus. And graphically, Hustle Kings looks really nice. So despite the odd musical choices, spooky floating cue, bad connectivity, and annoying precision camera, Hustle Kings is still a good game.",1
"106","In light of its technical flaws, we'd only cautiously recommend buying it on Vita. If you own a PS3, Xbox 360 or Wii U, you'd be better off with any of those versions, while those seeking a fast-paced racer that really makes their Vita sing should consider WipEout 2048 ahead of this.",1
"107","More variety in the graphics and gameplay modes would have helped, but for those who want to listen to music on a long flight, for example, Symphony provides an excellent way to enhance that experience and get a little gaming satisfaction on the way.",1
"108","Supernatural doesn't augment your Sims or make the neighborhood more interesting: it turns it into an unrecognizable mess that doesn't even come close to resembling the ""life simulator"" it's supposed to be.",0
"109","There's just not much about Snapshot, graphically, gameplay-wise, or in any other way, that makes it stick out from the pack.",1
"110","The Secret World flirts with brilliance and – at least, during earlier zones – looks primed to seal the deal. But, as time goes on, its its seemingly bottomless bag of tricks starts to look a bit shallow.",1
"111","The real strength of When Vikings Attack is its humor. It doesn't take itself seriously, and provides a nice change of pace from the deluge of first-person shooters and bloody action games we're all becoming more accustomed to. But its gameplay won't hook you for more than a passing few hours.",1
"112","The idea of rotating orbits and fantastic aesthetics make Unstoppable Gorg feel striking and unique to start, but the rest of the game doesn't live up to that great first impression.",1
"113","War of the Roses isn't quite Mount and Blade or Battlefield, but it manages to walk a fine line between the two models to produce an innovative and enjoyable experience.",1
"114","The interplay between Horatio and Crispin as they push deeper into this pixelated robotic realm to recover their stolen goods is a high point in an adventure that feels like a bit of a slog despite its relatively short length.",1
"115","There's plenty to like about Retro City Rampage from its nods to our childhoods to its easy to get behind gameplay to its arcade mini-games, but the story -- the main hook of the title -- just doesn't stand up.",1
"116","A fine game that Mega Man fans will enjoy once or twice, but one without that special something that would allow it to rise to the greatness Mega Man so regularly reached in its heyday.",1
"117","The moves and kills you'd expect are here, but the story is boiled down to be easy to jump in and out of. That takes away some of the excitement in playing through it.",1
"118","It attempts to hit a note that would resonate with the hardcore gaming masses, but it falls short, and should only be purchased by those desperate for an experience like it on Vita.",1
"119","The game never embraces its Mario heritage, never allowing itself to break out of a more typical tennis mold to be something unique.",1
"120","It's Piranha Bytes' most accessible game yet, and though its style and boorish, humorous dialogue fit well with the pirate motif, it's a role-playing experience that uses convention as a crutch and marginalizes or strips away a lot of elements that made the studio's past games stand out.",1
"121","At its core, it's FIFA 13 on Wii U is FIFA 12 from last year. You should probably wait for next season.",1
"122","It's more of a short-term investment than some might be expecting, then, but while you're caught in its irresistible loot cycle, you'll probably find it very hard to put down.",1
"123","Touch My Katamari is well-controlled and fun while it lasts, but it feels like the series has stagnated. The touchscreen controls are welcome, but I wish the developers had been a bit more creative with the Vita's functionality.",1
"124","If you're at all interested in the interactive fiction genre, knowing full well that there's not a whole lot of actual interaction, that's an eminently fair price.",1
"125","Shad'O may not offer much in the way of new gameplay mechanics over the countless other tower defense games already available, but it distinguishes itself through its striking art design and compelling narrative.",1
"126","The vague story and uninspired puzzles weren't special enough to keep my attention after that initial sense of awe waned, though, and when viewed alongside some annoying constraints that make the gameplay feel unnecessarily constrained, Little Inferno's few great ideas fall apart like so much ash.",1
"127","Beyond the winning localization and expert voice acting, though, playing through this adventure just felt lacking – its various unique ideas and innovations never came together to create a real sense of fun.",1
"128","Although it suffers from some inconsistent AI, spotty online matchmaking and some balancing problems created by Golden Abyss-centric augments, it's still hard to deny that Uncharted: Fight For Fortune is a fun game.",1
"129","Just Dance 4 is a generator of awkward moments, an engine powering missteps and bodily mayhem. Whether this is frustrating or fun will often come down to the blood alcohol level of the participants.",1
"130","There's an abundance of clever ideas at play in this undeniably creative 2D physics puzzle platformer -- the problem is they just don't translate to an experience you'll want to subject yourself to for very long once the steep difficulty really hits its stride.",1
"131","Ragnarok Odyssey doesn't deliver, and your money is better spent elsewhere.",1
"132","While it has some great mini-games, it forcefully limits itself and discards many of the ideas that made its predecessors so good.",1
"133","Because the gameplay is so straightforward, newbies to the genre who are nevertheless fans of the setting may find a friendly sort of Frankenstein monster to play with here.",1
"134","F1 2011 isn't quite up to the excellent standard of the console version, but it's still far, far better than the 3DS instalment.",1
"135","With more maps, classes, the ability to server browse and customization options promised there's a lot of potential in Forge, but what you're buying now feels like a beta with a great foundation.",1
"136","A functional shooter with a sense of humor and a Batman license. It's got plenty to unlock, but it's not all that deep. Go, shoot, win. Over and over. If you're looking for a first-person shooter that doesn't take itself seriously, have at it, but don't expect a FPS revolution.",1
"137","The combination of the excellent community, unwavering focus on running the business, and the simplicity of the controls and your responsibilities creates a unique business simulation that rewards you proportionally to the amount of work you put into it.",1
"138","None of its individual parts is particularly original, but put together in the way they have been, you end up with a synergistic success of a puzzle title that will test both reflexes and noggin-scratching abilities.",1
"139","Though 2 Dawn did an admirable job of blending accessible vehicle-based combat with a few instances of more sophisticated mechanics, it feels like the game could have used more development time to smooth out the technical issues and, ideally, add in more weapons and combat options.",1
"140","Flight is best sampled in its freebie guise.",1
"141","Shiny new Unreal Engine 3 graphics can't make up for simplistic, glitchy AI, a middling level selection, and busted, extremely underpopulated multiplayer. Go with Painkiller: Black Edition instead.",1
"142","Warriors Orochi 3 Hyper, while damaged in the shift from the other HD systems to the Wii U, ends up maintaining its appeal as one of this series' best installments.",1
"143","Despite its visual beauty and impressive execution, limited gameplay and general bugginess hold everything back. This beast has room to grow. When it does, expect great things. For now, a little turbulence makes for a bumpy ride.",1
"144","If you're a football obsessive or a stickler for the real thing, UEFA Euro 2012 is probably worth grafting onto your existing copy of FIFA 12. But for many, the same experience can easily be approximated by playing the game they already own with a through-ball from their imagination.",1
"145","Looks spectacular and does succeed in capturing the feeling of being a soaring bird, but falls short most everywhere else.",1
"146","There are good ideas, but that's not enough.",0
"147","Breathtaking to behold and controls beautifully, with well-designed levels and fun platforming. It's really too bad the experience is hampered by its unacceptably short length, as well as by the fact that the painting mechanic gets repetitive.",1
"148","If you haven't played FreakyForms before, this is probably the version to get, though the few improvements aren't enough to make the extra investment worthwhile for those who already own the downloadable version.",1
"149","The menus bury the coolest stuff, the touch controls are peculiarly particular, and even though the Vita is a connected device, I feel alone when I play this. If you're looking for a bright and colorful kart racer with good mechanics, ModNation Racers: Road Trip fits the bill, but it doesn't excel anywhere else.",1
"150","The foundation of Orgarhythm is an enticing fusion of several game types. But the slow pacing of play, in conjunction with flawed command chains and unit path-finding, result in a miserable mess of unfulfilled potential.",0
"151","Levels quickly went from me being charming, engaging experiences to something I raced through as fast as I could. An hour into Pineapple Smash Crew I found I just wanted it to be over. And it's not even long.",1
"152","A passable option for those gamers looking for a little musical accompaniment to their parties. But a weak tracklist festers underneath Sing Party's accessible, bland exterior.",1
"153","The story here is forgettable, the action is formulaic, and the multiplayer is simplistic.",1
"154","Lucius can be engrossing, charming, and even darkly funny. Sadly, the game is bogged down by its poor execution, inconsistent atmosphere, buggy levels, and monotonous mission objectives.",1
"155","It mixes solid but underwhelming gameplay with a lackluster presentation. If you just want dungeons to crawl through and couldn't care less about polished menus and engaging stories, great.",1
"156","There's something to be said for slow-burn strategy games that require precise tweaks and purchases to gain the edge in battle. Unfortunately, Defenders of Ardania lacks these nuances and insists on wasting the player's time with needless limitations and wave after wave of opposing forces that result in an ongoing stalemate.",0
"157","Sol: Exodus may be a step in the right direction to bring back space combat games, but it certainly won't be the title that inspires a generation to demand more. Any gamer, and especially PC gamer, over 25 probably wants the genre to flourish like it used to, but a game like Sol, with all its bugs, repetitive levels and lackluster narrative, won't be what brings it back.",1
"158","Speaking of wasted potential, if the developers wished to shove the Wii U GamePad down players' throats, they should have at least done something interesting with it.",1
"159","Like the other Michael Jackson games, Vita's first rhythm game suffers from a short setlist and only one real mode of play. It's a shame the experience ends in a tragic few hours, as dancing with your fingertips offers a special sort of enjoyment fitting for the King of Pop's best tracks.",1
"160","Ultimately, it's all frustrating if you own a Vita – the potential of the hardware is not being explored. FIFA 13 should be an essential purchase, a way to continue the same great game while on the move, but instead it's a cynical cash-in. If you want to play FIFA on your Vita, the best option is to pick up FIFA Football from last year at half the price.",0
"161","Its clever premise is really nothing more than a series of annoying bottlenecks for the gamer, and with so little in terms of in-game diversity, no reasons exist to actually see and do everything unless you're a dedicated completionist or Trophy hunter.",1
"162","Army Corps of Hell has a great premise, some intense boss fights, and a fantastic soundtrack. Unfortunately, the repetitious gameplay bogs the experience down, making this a trip to hell that you're not going to want to keep returning to.",1
"163","It's a decent piece of (admittedly overpriced) software. And its pretty, vivid graphics and surprisingly catchy old-school inspired soundtrack certainly please aesthetically. But a strong hook doesn't exist.",1
"164","A generally good experience, and a fun one most of the time, but its issues keep it from truly ascending to the heights of being Spectacular. Or Sensational. Or Astonishing.",1
"165","Anna manages to create a few blood-chilling moments throughout its story, but most of the fear factor is neutered after you realize nothing can harm you.",1
"166","Just a bunch of poorly controlled quests weaved together with a very thin story. If it was only a few bucks, it would be a decent distraction for people looking to be ninjas on the go, but as a full price PlayStation Vita, I can't recommend it.",0
"167","This isn't just an upsetting sequel or me-too military shooter – Warfighter is disrespectful of your time and unwilling or unable to adapt to what's been done better elsewhere.",0
"168","The issues themselves are a little more engaging than before, but the departure of quirky campaigns and beloved former presidents like Abraham Lincoln and JFK pose significant threats to its replayability. Without them, The Political Machine 2012 is a sober reminder of the problem that's plagued American politics almost since the beginning: at heart, it's still just the same old game.",1
"169","For the Vita, this is inexcusable. Dreary, washed out colors make the LEGO elements indistinguishable from the non-LEGO ones, which robs the former of its trademark charm, and the latter of its magical ambiance.",0
"170","With a longer campaign and more content, Spirit Camera could have been a revolutionary experience. As is, it fails to go much farther than Face Raiders did - and that was free.",1
"171","The appeal of its randomly generated settings wears off quickly, the procedural level generation voids much sense of having an impact on the world, and the absence of any kind of compelling story or brilliantly designed levels eventually renders exploration a slog.",1
"172","Punishing players for staying the course through lengthy grind sessions seems counterintuitive when the idea is to generally keep people playing.",1
"173","Somewhere inside Miner Wars 2081 is an incredibly ambitious, frighteningly absorbing space game. As is, however, Keen Software's long-in-the-making opus feels like a half-complete realization of that vision.",1
"174","It has little ambition and middle-of-the-road execution. Nothing about this mini-game compilation stands out above any of the others we've seen on Wii – or Nintendo 64, for that matter.",1
"175","Funky Barn is very basic but passably entertaining. As a lower-price downloadable game it'd be much better value, but as a $50/£30 Wii U launch title it's more difficult to recommend.",1
"176","There's just not enough content or variety here to justify the expense of a full retail purchase.",1
"177","Dungeon Hunter: Alliance isn't as polished as Diablo and lacks the charm of Torchlight. Battling through its varied levels and sorting through mountains of loot is fun, when glitches don't get in the way.",1
"178","Asphalt Injection is a fun racing game, but it lacks depth, precision, and doesn't push the Playstation Vita to anything resembling its true potential.",1
"179","There's a bold premise lying underneath, but thanks to the marginalization of its promising building elements, it's little more than another mediocre shooter.",1
"180","Blowing up stuff is fun, but you'll end up fighting the controls and the game becomes a grind if you play it any real length of time.",1
"181","Playing Cortex Command breaks my heart. With online multiplayer, improved AI, more scenarios and a more fleshed out campaign it could be something truly great, but for now it's just a number of cool ideas and great looks grafted onto noticeably repetitious level design and sub-optimal local multiplayer.",1
"182","A baffling proposition: a racing game with barely any content. It might be cheap, but it's inexcusably lazy.",0
"183","Apart from the bugs, the game is just so utterly unappealing, aesthetically and from a gameplay perspective, that it feels almost like a tech demo (of tech from 1999), rather than an honest-to-goodness release title. Please don't waste your hard-earned dough on this mutt.",0
"184","Bad multiplayer, awful story, generic level design and a host of other issues turn what could have been Vita's biggest blockbuster into one of its biggest duds.",0
"185","Everything ESPN Sports Connection does has been achieved already. Older sports games - including the original Wii's pack-in, Wii Sports - accomplished the same goals better and without embarrassing technical issues.",0
"186","The cool art direction and quirky sci-fi world get squandered on some truly uninspired adventure gaming drudgery.",0
"187","There's not a whole lot to say about Fray that hasn't been said before about countless other games that were unnecessarily rushed out the door half-cooked. Neither its features nor its execution are worth the asking price.",0
"188","A prime example of a game that oversells and underdelivers.",0
"189","Its appeal is shortened by the ludicrous speed at which we can zip across it and grow tired of its lack of challenge.",1
"190","With strong visuals and convincing audio backing it up, I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent inside my P-36 Hawk, and its generous free-to-play model never got in the way.",1
"191","Dual Destinies won’t change anybody’s minds about the series’ brand of narrative-heavy, gameplay-light adventuring, but longtime fans will be thrilled by the full docket of goofy legal twists and turns and fun characters.",1
"192","While I appreciate the world, atmosphere, and mechanics, I can't help but wish that there was a light at the end of Don't Starve's dark and lonely tunnel.",1
"193","The default game mode of Mario and Donkey Kong: Minis on the Move is little more than a Nintendo-themed reskin of the 25-year-old Pipe Mania, and frustrates with its randomness. The much better Puzzle Palace and Many Mini Mayhem modes, thankfully, leave us with a good game overall.",1
"194","It’s amazingly inventive and full of color and bright-eyed character, but its control problems are so persistent they’re unignorable.",1
"195","It’s a relaxing and charming little adventure priced rather out of its comfort zone, but it is not without value.",1
"196","Its smaller levels, restrictive time limit, and floaty physics work well as a challenge mode add-on to an already terrific game. But as fun as it often is, this still feels more like an addendum to NSMBU – a remix, rather than something new that stands on its own.",1
"197","The bite-sized scope and limited choices available make me more interested to see what Shadowrun Returns will be a year from now, after the community has used the included mod tools to build on it, than in what it is today.",1
"198","In terms of story, dialogue, and encounter design, this add-on pales in comparison to the rest of Borderlands 2.",1
"199","Reus is a gorgeous-looking, imaginative game which suffers from over-baked mechanics, but those hungry for to play god are still likely to find one of their favourite Populous-style games in a long while.",1
"200","Arma III’s complexity is a double-edged sword. It takes a long time to comprehend, but once you’re comfortable enough with its mechanics to take advantage of them under pressure, you’re able to engage in a kind of large-scale tactical combat that’s simply not offered elsewhere.",1
"201","Neverwinter isn't a hardcore MMORPG, nor is it likely to compel you to cast aside your current favorite MMO to devote your full attention to it. But taken in small doses, it's a generally fun and free romp through one of fantasy's most beloved universes.",1
"202","Its emphasis on fragmented exploration and shallow leveling is the exact opposite of what Castlevania fans like myself love, want and have come to expect.",0
"203","The matchmaking system is straight-up broken, leading to frequent frustrating mismatches, and its four maps aren’t enough to keep me around for long.",1
"204","Miraculously miniscule price tag or not, Van Helsing is a damn (and probably damned) solid game.",1
"205","With unintuitive controls, puzzle mechanics that’ve been done better elsewhere, and a story with the depth of a coloring book, it’s hard to stay invested in this short adventure.",1
"206","For better or worse, Freedom Cry feels like an entire Assassin's Creed game distilled into five hours. That’s good, but it’s an Assassin’s Creed game that doesn’t include many of the steps forward that Black Flag so recently made.",1
"207","Ikachan is disturbingly short, but the winning game design and charm might make the $4.99 download worth your time, especially if you’re a fan of Cave Story or Nicalis’ other work.",1
"208","Digital Extremes has created something that's often genuinely fun to play, and given the cost of entry, Warframe's well worth a try if you're in the mood for something different.",1
"209","Its slant on side quests and completionism did, at first, scratch an itch for me, but Doki soon suffers from its sheer repetition, especially because it lacks any sort of tangible challenge. Doki-Doki Universe began to stumble from exceptional to acceptable as the hours wore on.",1
"210","The on-paper premise of a traumatic childhood brought to life as a playable short story is brilliant, but the wounded execution can’t quite sell the emotional expression.",0
"211","Played with a mouse and keyboard Spartan Assault becomes a much more enjoyable experience, better able to recreate classic moments of Halo brilliance, but it’s still limited by hit-and-miss mission design and fiction that takes the urgency out of this fight for survival.",1
"212","Though Burial at Sea Episode 1 may be a short vignette next to Infinite’s novel, it’s still one you aren’t likely to put down for the brief time it lasts -- and it’s priced accordingly at $15.",1
"213","A solid game, but one that feels like a testbed for something much better - once the designers have the guts to fully chart a new path instead of relying on tried and Aperture Science-tested concepts we’ve all already seen played out.",1
"214","Retrovirus successfully updates the little-used concept of 3D six-axis combat known best from Descent for contemporary audiences, but it suffers from insane difficulty spikes, a tendency toward repetition and a disjointed story.",1
"215","In the burgeoning sub-genre of physics-based, liquid platformers, Puddle is a game that only hits a little more than it misses.",1
"216","Thunder Wolves isn’t so much a wolf as a one-trick pony. And while that one trick – frantic, adrenaline-pumping action served with a healthy dose macho humor and feel-good firepower – is an exceptionally fun trick, it doesn't last long.",1
"217","While the animals are gorgeously detailed in their own right, learning about them and creating an enriching environment for the cuddly critters isn’t always presented in an enjoyable way.",1
"218","Once you get the hang of it all, the strategic combat and its required pre-game build strategy and in-game adaptivity is fun, but don’t expect to master its tricky team-based combat and overwhelming upgrade system without a serious commitment.",1
"219","The Last Ranger comes up short as a sequel, as it spends too much time retreading the same territory we saw in the first game and addresses none of its flaws.",1
"220","A fun but short addition to the franchise. It's an acceptable substitute to the console experience, mostly on the strength of its interesting villain and original story. Just don't expect to get as much content out of this one as you'd get on the consoles.",1
"221","It’s a relic from the early age of shooters that, while authentic, is so entrenched in outdated design and mechanics that it’s more frustrating than it is fun.",0
"222","Despite the intriguing fighting-game veneer, the mechanics underneath are very standard, and there’s not much else here to compensate for that fact.",1
"223","The Showdown Effect isn't all style and no substance, but it's definitely weighed disproportionately in favor of the former. On the upside, that means heaps of enticing potential, but it also leaves plenty of room for improvement. As is, Showdown Effect feels rough and unfinished.",1
"224","Dungeonland just isn't fun. Despite its great art style and goofy sense of humor, the mediocre gameplay gets easily buried beneath a grueling difficulty and a slew of glitches.",0
"225","The Jak and Daxter Collection’s three games are excellent, but if you have the ability to play them on the PS3 (or hell, even the PS2), then that's the way to go.",1
"226","Don't call this XCOM. While its tactical combat works well enough to prevent The Bureau: XCOM Declassified from being straight-up bad, everything else is fumbled so often and so bizarrely that I can’t recommend it.",1
"227","As a game about family relationships The Novelist is interesting and relatable up to a point, but it doesn’t have a great deal of emotional depth, and the further you get into it the more you notice the flaws in its characterisation. Despite that, though, it’s worth a few hours of your time.",1
"228","At moments it can be wildly entertaining, but those moments come bundled with a terrible camera, uneven level design, and combat that tends to cheat you as often as it challenges you.",1
"229","Slender: The Arrival manages to deliver some truly impressive scares, but you’ll have to wade through the muck of repetitive tasks and unfair enemies in order to experience them. I found more enjoyment in playing the free original installment, which delivers a powerful horror experience without the annoyances and filler.",1
"230","A Murder of Ravens saves The Raven: Legacy of a Master Thief from going down in flames, but its narrative repetition and technical defects make for a turbulent ride.",1
"231","Powerstar Golf manages to successfully marry an old-school arcade golf experience with some decidedly new-school ideas. The lack of proper online multiplayer is a bit of a blow, but the Rivals mode has the potential to provide an ongoing challenge after you’ve scooped up all of the career medals.",1
"232","It’s a serviceable arcade game that provides its own share of fun, but it’s also repetitive – occasionally gratingly so – with a façade of robust customization options hiding the fact that we’re doing the same thing over and over again underneath.",1
"233","It’s just not very good. Rare well-designed quests are overshadowed by a host of others that feel phoned in, and though the fundamentals of shooting are competent, weak enemy AI makes the PvE combat a bore.",1
"234","In some ways I'd equate SimCity to an early version of Minecraft: a wonderfully creative toy attached to a barely functional game.",1
"235","With dragon taming, action combat, and robust skill and housing systems, there's an enjoyable experience at the core of Dragon's Prophet that never manages to break free of the dull environment and grinding pace that surrounds it.",1
"236","Sonic Lost World clumsily tears all the wrong pages out of the Super Mario Galaxy playbook, and in so doing, loses the breathless speed and fluidity that makes a Sonic game a Sonic game.",1
"237","A complete disappointment. After such an exciting start, King Art allows the series to slide into mediocrity by subjecting us to illogical gimmickry and by replacing its hero with someone I couldn’t really care about.",1
"238","Developer High Moon gets the character and brings the funny, but none of the action finesse that would make Deadpool stand out.",1
"239","The mechanics don’t match the execution, and everything suffers as a result.",0
"240","A cool idea about robot armies battling across an entire solar system breaks apart when the realities of controlling multiple worlds at the same time set in.",0
"241","At its best, it presents a gleefully cutthroat philosophy of human interaction, pushing you to be as terrible as possible within a charming cartoonish parody. It doesn't always manage to hold onto that feeling, but Redshirt has enough unique personality to endure.",1
"242","Just be prepared for a lot of fog, a lot of loading, no voice acting and a jarring framerate.",1
"243","It's an eclectic mixture of imagination, interpretation, and (purposefully constrained) interaction that really doesn't work as often as it should, but – on the rare occasions when all the pieces fit together – it creates some heart-fluttering highs.",1
"244","Betrayer’s unique setting, style, and grim stories that pepper the journey all make this a game that’s eye-catching at first glance and briefly emotional. But the things you actually do in this world rarely come across as anything other than uninspired.",1
"245","It's a bland and perfunctory experience, one that won't offend anyone but is incapable of delighting anyone either.",1
"246","There are flashes of greatness in Lost Planet 3...But flashes are all they are, and the often frustrating metaphorical dimness between them makes up the bulk of its 15-hour single-player campaign gets in the way of admiring them.",1
"247","Plagued by a ho-hum delivery and combat occasionally interrupted by redeeming boss fights, it fails to distinguish itself.",1
"248","Behind its nice alien species graphics, there's little more than a collection of bland, samey gameplay regardless of what race you play as, tedious ship customization, and an AI that seems set to galactic griefer mode. You're better off setting out to conquer an alternate 4X universe.",0
"249","Batman: Arkham Origins - Blackgate is a good extension of the Arkham franchise to handhelds, but it lacks the specialness or inspiration that would make it stand out as a great Metroidvania-style game - or a great Batman game, for that matter. Without any real surprises, engaging settings, or interesting story, Blackgate feels more like a retread of bullet points than the handheld Batman we truly deserve.",1
"250","Rather than fix the graphics and the performance problems that plagued the original two years ago, Techland slightly modified the setting and delivered a new character and more content. It’s a fun time, but there are no surprises or killer new features to make it an impressive package.",1
"251","What worked in 2009's original first-person brawler works here as well, but inadequate maps, strange combat balancing, and several other quirks make it hard to call the sequel a substantial improvement beyond its new areas and creatures.",1
"252","Wario Ware was once bristling with creativity and energy, fizzing and sputtering with mad, short-form ideas, but Game & Wario is just a bit boring. The selection of games is sparse, and a couple of excellent ones don't make up for the rest.",1
"253","Ryse has an entertaining story and sky-high production values. The gameplay that’s there isn’t bad – it just stops in its tracks before it gets anywhere near close to demanding.",1
"254","It's an adequate twin-stick shooter, and a few years ago that might have been enough. With so many zombie games out there now though, one this uncommitted to its own ideas can never hope to be more than just part of the horde.",1
"255","Gates to Infinity fails as both a Pokémon and a Mystery Dungeon game, and reaching its meatiest content requires playing through hours and hours of tedium.",0
"256","While only the combat stands out as a true high-point, Mars: War Logs is at least an ambitious attempt at a budget RPG, in a much less overused setting than most.",1
"257","Sonic’s sensation of speed is mostly intact and most stages look impressive, but Sonic: Lost World stumbles due to poor level design.",1
"258","Its creepy ambiance and wide range of puzzles manage to carry the weaker segments, but an out-of-place final boss with timed platforming ruins the fun.",1
"259","It’s initially interesting, but the asking price is very high for such a basic and short-lived game.",1
"260","If you keep in mind that this is a budget release when setting expectations of how many maps, guns, and customization options it should contain, there’s plenty of fast-paced action to be had gunning all the way through Hades – one weeping classicist at a time.",1
"261","Some of the most disappointing games to play are those that have brilliant ideas, and even pull a few of them off, but can’t maintain quality across the board. Horizon is an extreme example of that category, where a quarter of it is some of the cleverest design turn-based space strategy has seen in years, half of it is fine, and the last quarter is virtually unplayable.",1
"262","The main problem with Space Hulk, though, is that its designers couldn't let it deviate from or build on the simple rules of a board game experience that lacks tactical depth.",1
"263","There’s little of the engaging combat and compelling visual progression systems found in classic isometrics like Diablo and Baldur’s Gate, nor is there the scope and wealth of content that characterises major MMO games. Given the talent and license behind it, that’s a real shame.",1
"264","Island Tour’s single-player campaign is laughably bad, and the ambitious, content-rich multiplayer options and unique game boards are ultimately dragged down by mostly boring minigames and unfortunate system-jerking motion control.",1
"265","A big, ambitious blunder of a game that very occasionally sings with inspired ideas. Its transition to the Vita brings little other than touch screen control and a more attractive game-world.",1
"266","Great horror stories are many things, but tedious isn’t on the list, and that’s exactly the feeling that’s born of Knock-Knock’s inability to explain itself.",1
"267","Leisure Suit Larry Reloaded isn’t a total bust. Its self-deprecating humor still elicits plenty of chuckles and some of the gags are gross and/or clever, but the tiresome cycle of saving and reloading just to pay your way from place to place saps away a lot of the joy.",0
"268","Once bugs start popping up, the experience on Vita starts to become as infected as the civilians Spider-Man fights to rescue. Audio issues, frame-rate problems, and even a few game-crashing bugs all tarnish this otherwise-decent game. There is very little reason to pick up this game for your Vita.",0
"269","There’s some nostalgic value, too, but its weak graphics and frustrating free-flight boss fights make it tough to enjoy the stroll down memory lane.",1
"270","Mario & Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games has some of the best online capabilities on the Wii U, but it unwisely forces use of poor motion controls in almost every mode.",0
"271","Playing Knack is like watching a dull movie on a plane – it's tolerable if all you want is a way to pass the time, but it's not something you'd seek out for its own sake. I finished in about 11 hours and, challenges, co-op, and secrets aside, there's just not much here worth recommending.",1
"272","It suffers from an almost total absence of risk or failure even on the hardest difficulty. There's charm and a good soundtrack in store here, but it quickly loses its appeal amid gameplay that never stops feeling as though you're working your way through a tutorial.",1
"273","I’d happily grind for hours and hours if Akaneiro had fun combat, entertaining enemies or a great skill system. Unfortunately, it doesn’t, and in place is a barebones action-RPG that feels determined to make me spend money on a game that feels threadbare.",0
"274","It's an uninspired retread of good concepts, and an unfortunate visitor into a genre with some genuine giants. It might take you on a long trip across the globe to visit some attractive locations, but by the end the only temples I cared for were throbbing away in my head.",0
"275","With all the crashing and lame microtransactions, it’s kind of ridiculous that this is the first Halo game to appear on Microsoft’s next-generation console.",1
"276","Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2 isn’t bereft of good ideas or mechanics, it’s just that they’re all trapped in a short series of levels that rarely give you anything all that interesting to do with them.",1
"277","Between its lack of personality or distinctive, original features of any kind, and completely non-existent multiplayer community, the only memorable aspect is its annoying and frustrating difficulty spikes.",0
"278","Its inconsistent gameplay becomes tedious despite its imaginative variety, and its levels lack cohesion or a sense of momentum. Like the cheesy 90's films it apes, LocoCycle is memorable, but not quite good.",1
"279","Valhalla Knights 3 is a disappointment. It has fun moments, but actually enjoying it means wading through a bog of repetition that left me feeling tired and dirty when I reached the other side.",1
"280","Ultimately, I found myself getting more and more frustrated with each death until it got to the point where completing a level felt like more of a relief than an accomplishment.",1
"281","As of right now the PC version is decidedly the worst version. I had no problems connecting to games on the 360, at least – not that I really wanted to.",0
"282","The controls are sometimes clunky and unresponsive when walking around, and the screen even froze once right in the middle of a transaction. Add in a poorly designed village that’s too spread out and a temperamental camera that keeps changing angles, and Hometown Story’s mechanics go from forgivably faulty to downright aggravating.",1
"283","Aliens: Colonial Marines looks like Aliens, and sounds like Aliens, but unfortunately it just doesn’t feel like Aliens. Instead, it feels indistinguishable from almost every shooter you’ve played in the past twenty years.",1
"284","Even if you're a life-long Star Trek fan like I am, you don't want to beam down anywhere near this thing.",0
"285","A terribly executed arcade flight game.",0
"286","NBA Live’s flaccid return is made all the more disappointing because we waited three years for it. After all that time, NBA Live 14 in no way advances the basketball sim genre and, worse, leaves little to be optimistic about for next year.",0
"287","Dark is a stealth action adventure that's brimming with good ideas, but poor AI, a weak story, and repetitive gameplay drive a three-pronged stake through the heart of its entertainment value. Dark's cel-shaded settings occasionally allow the otherwise drab experience to shine, but not without a forgettable protagonist and clunky movements sinking their fangs into the fun.",0
"288","Mix in the monotony of the core gameplay, and you get a game that's impossible to recommend, no matter how bad you want to hook some bass.",0
"289","There’s nothing natural about AI that faces the wrong way in combat, or a shooter who doesn’t know what gear he brought into combat, or squad members who can’t communicate. When shooting for authenticity, a half step is not enough.",0
"290","No matter what happens with stability and bug-fixing patches, its poor controls, awful interface, and dull pacing ensure that X Rebirth will remain unpleasant for all but the most forgiving, die-hard space jockeys.",0
"291","While this isn't among the worst movie video game tie-ins, it certainly doesn’t buck the trend of mediocrity. It’s simply… not arresting.",0
"292","It's gesture recognition is abysmal, its fighting is shallow, and it wastes too much time trying to clumsily tell a silly, unnecessary story. In short, it's everything Microsoft promised Kinect 2.0 wouldn't be.",0
"293","Save for a few puzzles that lose luster due to unintuitive and touchy physics, I mostly enjoyed testing both my platforming timing and my problem-solving skills with Kalimba's brain-busters.",1
"294","It may seem strange to complain that a game’s too long, but when the genuine scares of being hunted by an unstoppable predator are so diluted by repetition and padding, Isolation’s epic length really does work against it.",1
"295","Elite: Dangerous is a beautiful game and an amazing space sim let down by a universe devoid of character and low on excitement.",1
"296","Kirby Triple Deluxe may look great and has some clever ideas for how to use 3D, but falls into a rut of simple platforming and puzzles that rarely require any thought or skill. I admire that it tries to give us more powers and abilities to play with than ever before, but that empowerment shouldn’t come at the expense of any real difficulty.",1
"297","I have no doubt that the strength of the tactical combat will help find a strong niche, but for me, that just makes the relative weakness of the strategic side of gameplay all the more disappointing.",1
"298","It’s Adventure mode is beautifully designed, and new power-ups and character abilities switch up the usual bread-and-butter platforming gameplay, but it’s let down by limited options for co-operative play and most significantly, a number of game-breaking bugs on the PlayStation 4.",1
"299","It’s a shame that Isolation doesn’t track stats, because I’d be curious to know how many of its roughly 15-20 hours I spent hiding in lockers, staring at the motion tracker, and, most of all, how many hundreds (yes, hundreds) of times I died without a chance to save myself.",1
"300","Someday, someone is going to make an incredible Alien video game that checks every box. But, sadly, Isolation is not it.",1
"301","Episode 4: Amid the Ruins is the weakest episode of The Walking Dead: Season 2. Despite its major changes -- both regarding Clementine as a character and the roles of those around her -- there are too many out-of-left-field events to build tension convincingly.",1
"302","Balance issues and multiplayer bugs remain, but there's enough variety found in its tower defense scenarios and three classes to warrant donning the legendary monster hunter's hat either again or for the very first time.",1
"303","It’s slightly off-putting that it definitely takes too long to get to the higher levels, and consequently that it strays close to undermining that desire to instantly have “just one more go.” The overall quality of the matching experience was ultimately strong enough to pull me back, largely helped by the smart secondary Puzzle Mode.",1
"304","D4 is an intriguing experience, and brimming with personality. It’s also the most polished game from Access to date, with a genuinely first-rate presentation.",1
"305","It’s mostly the moments in between battles that bring the whole experience down, as a lack of information and poor menus tarnish this flying ace.",1

"307","It will probably hold my interest far longer than Tropico 4 did. But at the same time, it's rough edges are a continual annoyance. The larger issue is that while Tropico 5 definitely introduces some new challenges and ideas, it's still a dangerously simple city-builder.",1

"312","For those of us weaned on old-school click-and-point adventures (or anyone who wants to experience Sierra On-Line’s glory days), there’s no question - this is a must-play. The rest of you may be fascinated by its anachronisms, but still be dazzled by its dramatic story and classic puzzles.",1

"321","A noble attempt at creating a new kind of science-fiction strategy game that’s sadly weaker than the sum of its parts.",1
"322","The storytelling presumes you already know the source material by heart, which means things are sometimes a bit disjointed, and the game, like the movies it’s based on, ends at an awkward place. But like almost all the Lego games, this is a journey worth taking.",1

"349","Gauntlet can't quite strike the balance between the nostalgic arcade experience and a modern-day replay-friendly adventure. It's cool that there's such a varied experience amongst the iconic quartet of heroes, and four-player co-op is almost always fun with the right crew, but its repetitive structure works against its longevity.",1
"350","Every aspect -- from the humor to the puzzles to the live action cutscenes -- feels beamed here straight from the ‘90s. Sometimes it’s charming, and others, it’s just dated.

"357","A good game with its heart in the right place. Its Cold War premise is brilliant, its art is beautiful, and its music is lovely. When it comes to gameplay, the stealth action sputters a bit in its inconsistent AI and inaccurate aiming, but it still delivers a fun experience.",1
"358","Its story is sparse and the impact of its conclusion isn’t fully worked through, yet it’s worth playing for the way in which it manipulates perspective and transforms everyday locations into nightmarish reflections.",1

"365","Very little of what’s made it a blast to play over the last couple of years hasn’t been poisoned by this version’s technical issues. Its compromised visuals rob it of much of its bombastic charm, while its erratic performance and unreliable touch controls keep the gameplay from shining like it has in the past.",1

"373","It plays extremely well, whether online or offline, proving why EA Sports' long-running series has been the king of the ice for over 20 years. But there needs to be a reason to keep playing, and it's there that NHL 15 falls short and feels somewhat vacant.",1
"374","Mind Zero is an enjoyable dungeon crawler with engaging battles, lively voice acting, and oodles of exploration.",1
"375","I had some fun free-to-play battles with Loadout, but far more time was spent mired in frustration or feeling under-fulfilled with a purchased campaign victory; it's not quite ""pay to win,"" but it definitely is ""pay to win with a lot less hassle.""",1
"376","Although NBA Live 15 looks significantly better than NBA Live 14 at a glance, it still suffers from clumsy controls and stiff animations. A few nice changes and additional game modes can’t make up for poor gameplay, but there are some great ideas here that just don’t get a chance to shine.",1
"377","Being a ghost in Murdered is enjoyable in fits and starts, yet the use of your powers is brutally limited, resulting in an almost entirely scripted and therefore watered-down afterlife experience.",1
"378","There are some great concepts in Murdered: Soul Suspect, but they feel undercooked or underutilised, and the lack of demand for any real input from us makes Murdered feel like a pick-a-path game where there’s only one path.",1
"379","There's a wonderful nugget at its core, but the final product, when all features and factors combine, never shines enough to recommend it without a series of caveats.",1
"380","The Castle Doctrine is a brutal, minimalist depiction of urban paranoia that brings out the worst in its players, and I struggled to find value in it.",0
"381","A beautifully detailed, enjoyably shallow experience that's better with friends. Sacred 2 fans hoping for a real action-RPG likely won't be pleased, but as a simple, straightforward slash-'em-up, this stands ably enough on its own.",1

"388","While Escape Dead Island’s workmanlike combat and ho-hum zombies fail to fully capitalize on this unoriginal but respectably executed premise, it does manage to punctuate its enjoyable filler with some genuinely spectacular moments of madness.",1
"389","Enemy Front's attempt to show a different side of war is thwarted by awful AI and behind-the-times combat that can't support the emphasis it puts on stealth and sniping. The multiplayer could have been a saving grace, but it's so threadbare that a sizable player community seems highly unlikely.",0
"390","Daylight has a good foundation of scary atmosphere and interesting bits of story. All of that is squandered by the first half, where poor level design, unnecessary box-pushing puzzles, and impotent enemies deflate the scares before it even gets going. By the time I reached the more interesting second act, I’d grown immune to its tricks and could only see it as a mediocre series of fetch quests.",1
"391","It scrapes by on the power of its central whodunnit mystery, but I can’t help but feel that Murdered: Soul Suspect is ten hours worth of unfinished business.",1
"392","A Transformers game really only has to deliver on two simple things: make it fun to transform, and make it fun to destroy robots. Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark is a dud on both of those fronts, and it throws in a confusing story to boot.",0
"393","A bizarre game that works on paper but much less on screen. At first glance it's fun, but after a while it loses its steam and it becomes tedious and frustrating.",1

"404","There was more to the classic shooters than speedy movement and accurate guns, which is just about all Rekoil has going for it. The rest is a mess of bugs and bad design choices.",0
"405","Its exploration is so-so, its brawling is tedious, its characters are annoying, and the only stages where it feels like a Sonic game are the ones most likely to suffer technical problems.",0
"406","With just two modes, generic levels, a grating aesthetic, and an interface that damages the play experience, Basement Crawl would lack anything to keep us around even if it functioned soundly.",0
"407","It’s a decent MOBA with some good ideas, and it has a promising patch-filled future, but they need refinement before Heroes of the Storm can join the big leagues.",1
"408","I just wish that the dating elements had been more smoothly incorporated into the established narrative and not forced (gruesomely at times) on the player. Sometimes, it’s enough to just be friends.",1
"409","Etrian Odyssey is a meaty adventure with dozens of dungeon floors and bone-crushing challenges to overcome with its competent turn-based combat. The story isn’t perfect, but I was happily kept busy with exploring the world, battling bosses, and feeding the hungry citizens of my hubtown.",1

"414","Rising Tide's great new diplomacy and artifacts can't quite fix Civ: Beyond Earth's replayability problems.",1
"415","Despite a handful of funny, emotional moments, Escape Plan Bravo is a low point for the Tales series. Its events lack weight, many of the characters are underutilized, and the abrupt ending left me far from satisfied.",1
"416","I give Apotheon high praise for its homage to old-school side-scrolling adventures and its ability to recreate the captivating style of Ancient Greek art. Unfortunately, a ho-hum story and frustrating controls prevent me from doing the same for its moment-to-moment gameplay.",1
"417","Outside of those great few levels, Woolly World is a more forgettable and fragmented experience. Cool mechanics are cooked up, but they’re dropped into levels which never realise their full potential and fixate more on unearthing frustrating collectibles.",1
"418","An experience that generally feels unique and fun.",1
"419","Dontnod has created great scenarios for a story I’m eager to learn more about, but the moment-to-moment interactions with people in Max Caulfield’s life are pretty painful.",1

"425","Wolfenstein: The Old Blood places almost all its bets on the intense combat carried over from the game that came before it. The weapons feel great, and the arenas are interesting and filled with opportunity for some strategic creativity.

"436","Episode 4: Metamorphosis does a satisfactory job at tying up Resident Evil Revelations 2’s mysteries, yet it also presents us with the clunkiest gameplay and dialogue we’ve seen in this series. While the bonus episodes and robust Raid mode extend the life of Revelations 2 beyond the credits, I wish it had gone out with a slightly bigger bang.",1
"437","One Piece’s unique style of fighting also translates quite well to musou combat, but fitting in the story bogs down that combat somewhat. Instead of enjoying both fighting and dialogue, it became a weird kind of chore to play through battles just to progress the story.",1
"438","The potential of powerful, story-altering choices is largely blown on an episode full of out-of-character portrayals and padding scenes that don’t move us any closer to the finish line.",1
"439","While the story of these likable new characters continues after the shocking events of the premiere, the second episode makes it feel like a false start by neglecting to advance the plot in interesting ways.",1
"440","At its best, Just Cause 3's over-the-top action and physics-based mayhem has me laughing out loud on the regular. It’s a damn shame so many performance problems and punishing load times keep cropping up, because I love what Just Cause 3 does. But for game that’s so heavily dependent on action to run this poorly is no laughing matter.",1
"441","Episode 1 is let down by dull environments and creature design, but a terrific co-op mode, intriguing story, and replayable Raid Mode balances out its flaws. Not quite a headshot, then; but it’s left a bloody impression on me nonetheless.",1
"442","Hard West isn’t the deepest game of its kind, but it does a good job of walking the line between cold, hard tactics, and Weird West-style personality.",1
"443","As much as I enjoyed its aggressive brand of tactical combat and interesting enemy types, there are too many unpredictable variables outside your control, and too much happening to too many quickly aging, mortal characters for this tactical game to feel like decisions matter.",1
"444","Anno 2205 is an engaging and strategic city builder with unique challenges in each of its attractive biomes. But ultimately, it manifests as a never-ending treadmill of trying to supply the picky, luxury-loving consumers of the 23rd century with more techno-garbage.",1
"445","Lost Dimension is greatly held back by its inability to keep up the pressure of the disappointing betrayal system and its poorly written story. Still, this RPG manages to find its footing with its excellent combat system and interesting character abilities.",1
"446","It manages to maintain interest with randomized dungeons that usually work out well, but could really benefit from some balance tweaks and a way to put more fully developed decks to the test.",1
"447","Though it doesn’t always allow you to play it the way it seems to beg to be played, it still manages to be enjoyable overall until the credits roll.",1
"448","It’s still a little too slow-paced and predictable to recommend wholeheartedly.",1
"449","When the spectacular fireworks and hilarious, delightfully destructive chaos kick off, the frame rate often drops well below 30 frames per second. And when the frame rate drops, it’s much harder to defy death as you’re piloting one of the many helicopters, jets, or cars, or stay in the air when you’re using the fun but touchy wingsuit. When you die, you’re subjected to loading times that can last 90 seconds or more.",1
"450","Quirks aside, Legends of Eisenwald is a strong, simple tactical RPG that’s all the better for staying within its means.",1
"451","The drama might not be as heightened as something like The Walking Dead, but I still found myself surprisingly invested in the choices I had to make about my companions, undeveloped as they may be, and smiling at the Minecrafty in-jokes.",1

"462","Chilling ghosts and a malevolent story make the new Fatal Frame an unsettling experience.",1

"465","It manages to scratch a very old PC gaming itch, at least between the awful cutscenes and performance problems.",1
"466","While the first half of The Park tends to lean a bit too hard into the horror tropes of a spooky carnival, the final act does a really great job of developing a character with the pathos that comes from being a mother who’s having a tough time dealing with the impossible stress that comes from being a parent. Sure, it’s some of the same ground that Silent Hill games have covered in the past, but that doesn’t diminish its effectiveness.",1
"467","Customizing my own character’s equipment and move pool is fantastic...but it’s hard to get excited when combat feels hollow, especially for a franchise all about heroes stronger than Superman.",1
"468","It's supported by a few memorably silly cutscenes, but Gat Out of Hell isn't as story-rich or even as funny as previous Saints Row expansions, and so it ends up feeling like a missed opportunity, settling for a shallow diversion when it could have put a grand coda on Saints Row IV's story.",1
"469","Neverwinter's gamepad-friendly combat and intuitive interface make it the best fantasy MMORPG I’ve played on a console yet.",1
"470","In my experience, two types of people get the most enjoyment out of Mario Party: Small children and inebriated adults. Nintendo's intended audience in Mario Party 10, as with its predecessors, is clearly kids (they will probably love the amiibo tapping).",1
"471","Need for Speed looks the part, sounds the part, and is surprisingly reverent to real-world car culture. I like the direction Ghost has taken here, and I think it’s the right one, but beneath its flashy exterior it's not quite firing on all cylinders.",1
"472","Halo: Spartan Strike's upgraded parts aren't immediately apparent, but the sum total is pretty striking. A pinch of better aiming here, a heaping helping of Promethian enemies there, and annoying microtransactions nowhere make Spartan Strike worth the quick and cheap sub-ten-dollar tour.",1
"473","It charmed me with its blend of old-school RPG and contemporary satire, but nearly lost my vote with its sluggish pacing, irritatingly high enemy encounter rate, and crashes.",1
"474","With few features, annoying AI, and broken multiplayer, it's hard to appreciate F1 2015's improved driving.",1
"475","Sid Meier’s Starships’ battles held my attention for a handful of games, after which point the tactical AI’s behavior became exploitable and the strategic layer became too muddled and unpredictable.",1
"476","Its best aspects are its stunning looks, atmosphere, and style – which are truly fantastic – and entertaining fiction. But the shallow, slow, and generic quick-time event-riddled gameplay make it feel like an experience that would've been better served by a non-interactive movie than a game.",1
"477","Despite some good ideas and cool design choices, Whispering Willows can't deliver a wholly fulfilling experience.",1
"478","The single-player campaign is paper thin, combat and enemies are repetitive, and the fan service kept to a minimum. On the other hand, adding other players to the mix lets you find the fun in its smooth controls, coordinating attacks against hordes of enemies, and tough competitive duels.",1
"479","Batgirl: A Matter of Family has a decent story, an impressive setting, and some respectable brawls and Predator fights, but it’s all so disappointingly brief and self-contained.",1
"480","A lean tie-in that at least provides some great-looking new cars, a boost of nitrous, and a short but appropriately themed set of races. It’s fun while it lasts, but it’s also proved to be disappointingly built around recycled maps and events.",1
"481","Concessions are often made when sports games straddle the gap between console generations old and new, but considering the two year wait for a game that is only being released on current gen hardware (and PC), the rampant slash and burn of its feature set is particularly galling.",1

"486","The bones of a decent procedural horror game are buried under roughly six feet of frustrating fixed camera angles, insta-death, and bad checkpointing. Ultimately, it’s just not that much fun being a detective in the dark.",1
"487","The great tragedy of Sword Coast Legends is that the last couple of years have all but paved the way for it to emerge as the best of the cRPG renaissance, but its dull cooldown-based combat, linear quests, and cookie-cutter user-made content ensure that it's likely to be among the first to be forgotten.",1

"493","It’s lack of accessible controls or incentive for laboring through arduous stages, combined with the sloppy presentation of its story suggests that Aaru woke up a little prematurely.",1

"497","Submerged attempts to replace tension with curiosity as a motivating force, and largely succeeds even though its environmental storytelling isn’t as dense as it could’ve been.",1
"498","In the moments where Submerged rewarded inquisitiveness, I loved it. When it occasionally stumbled in that responsibility, I found myself wishing for a more polished and complete world to explore.",1
"499","While it was nice to get some freedom with the Omni-Directional Maneuver gear and to play with some new items in World Mode, the missions bogged down the fun.",0
"500","The amiibo integration is cumbersome and hard to play with, and interesting ideas like the use of the stalk market are limited by a slow pace. It’s delightful enough to make me smile, but it’s still a bit boring.",1

"503","Apart from it’s massive roster of Kaiju and an encyclopedia of monsters, Godzilla's poor graphics, uncomfortable controls, and overly repetitive missions make this one of the worst renditions of the King of the Kaiju since he fought Matthew Broderick in Madison Square Garden back in ‘97.",0
"504","Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 5’s rare moments of nostalgic joy are drowned out by its abundance of poorly thought out levels, control problems, bugs, and its glaring lack of attitude. It boggles the mind that a $60 game in 2015 can be riddled with so many technical issues.",0
"505","I genuinely do think the potential for a good pirate game is in here, somewhere, but Raven’s Cry is a mess of bugs, hazards, hiccups, oversights, and progression-halting crashes.",0
"506","Doom is a tale of two very different shooters (and one quirky creation tool). The single-player campaign's reverent worship of the series' roots results in an old-school run-and-gun shooter which feels like imitation Doom, a cover of an old hit which nails all the right power chords but isn't exactly transformative. The multiplayer's attempts to borrow from the new to reinvigorate the old results in an experience which won't satisfy either school of thought. SnapMap, meanwhile, is a blend of weird and simple and endearing.",1
"507","The divide between the highs and lows of The Last Guardian is staggering. For every wonderful moment of absolute beauty and emotional attachment to its lifelike companion, there’s an equal and opposite baffling moment that ruins the mood with frustrating controls and camera angles. But I found myself willing to put up with all of these hiccups if it meant experiencing any of its multitude of incredibly-beautiful moments.",1
"508","Severed starts as a fun take on touch combat, but ends as a tiring journey that neglects its cooler features.",1
"509","A good combat system and gorgeous visuals are significantly let down by an underwhelming and perfunctory narrative that can make progression a real chore. Whilst there are elements that work in isolation, Bravely Second doesn't manage to tie them together in a way that matches the quality of the original.",1
"510","There’s enough snappy dialogue and silliness in Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Spirit of Justice to satisfy long-term series fans, and the conventional courtroom sequences still feel rewarding when you get on a roll and a witness starts to unravel. But the heavy-handed mysticism of its bloated middle act and the general lack of innovation makes for a less than essential entry in the Phoenix Wright saga on the whole.",1
"511","Both in combat and out, there are some clearly good ideas, especially the tense and dangerous Dark Zone. But they’re not spread evenly or interwoven cleanly enough to form a cohesive, consistently enjoyable loop.",1
"512","Ultimately, The Division’s overly busy, conflicted design philosophies drown its best ingredients in a bland slurry that never quite comes together into a cohesive dish.",1
"513","Next to every good thing The Division does, there hangs a big, ugly asterisk. That same open world is barren and unengaging, combat gets bogged down with samey waves of walking bullet sponges, and character progression is awkwardly fractured in inconvenient ways.",1

"517","While there was enough variety in the mechs to keep me playing through a full season of matches, the sub-par visuals distract, and big matchmaking issues made online wait times unbearable. It’s fun to play with friends, but try to take it for a spin before committing, if only to make sure your stomach can actually handle it.",1
"518","World of Final Fantasy is a humorous adventure that is just too cute for words, but its combat and exploration aren’t diverse enough to support a campaign nearly as long as this one. However, I did enjoy it for a long time - more than 30 hours - before it wore out its welcome.",1
"519","There are a lot of good ideas in Battlefleet Gothic: Armada, and it certainly looks like a great tactical space combat game. But it struggles to build that into a coherent whole, making it tough to recommend unless you’re willing to utterly dedicate yourself to fully comprehending the inaccessible systems of its combat.",1
"520","When it works and none of the seven players have any audio or connectivity issues, Werewolves Within is competitive, surprisingly friendly, easy to jump into and even easier to play for hours on end, building up an active repertoire of new online friends as you go. When it doesn’t work, though, it’s inexcusably hard to play, and that’s unfortunately very often.",1

"523","The beautiful Wii U graphics and playful humor stay true to the spirit of the Paper Mario franchise, but the story is straightforward and a bit bland.",1
"524","While it finds its strongest moments in its rewardingly rhythmic, precision-based one-on-one duels, an unwelcome level of tedium and occasionally cheap sequences — made even more frustrating by janky mechanics — keep the action from being as consistently strong as it is visually stylish.",1
"525","Hitman Episode 3: Marrakesh doesn’t reach the highs of the previous levels and features the worst voice acting so far.",1
"526","Being Batman in Akrham VR is a great way to more intimately experience Rocksteady's universe and to search for clues in this brief mystery. However, the world and characters around you are largely rigid and unresponsive to your actions, which leaves a lot on the table for a game about a character known as much for his brawn as he is for his brains.",1
"527","Its mechanics are solid but largely unoriginal, and its themes and world-building are genuinely great. And while it never reaches the originality and heights of its inspirations, it still manages to deliver an interesting world with one heck of a twist.",1
"528","Despite its improved HD veneer and tweaked controls, I just didn’t find the Amplitude of 2016 to be as addictive or long-lasting an experience as the Amplitude of 2003.",1
"529","Though the epilogue has some serious pacing problems, Attack on Titan is a fun, bloody take on the series.",1
"530","I was so happy this game was being made, but in the end I’m just as disappointed in how it turned out.",1
"531","A moderately successful execution of the standard 4X formula with a flair for leaders and enjoyably complex combat.",1
"532","The core idea behind Super Mario Maker is the ability to create, play, and share your creation, but the 3DS drops the ball on the last part of that credo. It’s worth noting that designing stages is as easy at it is convenient on the portable 3DS, but not having a larger platform to showcase unique creations left me wondering what the point is. It’s still an excellent way to play a bottomless pit of classic-style 2D Mario, though, and that makes it worth keeping in your pocket.",1
"533","A very predictable update to a long-running series of dancing games that shines in visual design and unique choreography but is very loose with its tracking of your body movements. It’s not going to teach you to be a professional dancer, and it honestly doesn’t really teach you how to be good at Just Dance itself. That said, it’s still a whole lot of fun to play, and the songs that aren’t locked behind a paywall are varied and, largely, recognisable.",1
"534","While this is the weakest episode in Batman’s Telltale series yet, my investment in the unpredictable, multi-layered plot hasn’t wavered, thanks to the critical state of each of Bruce Wayne’s relationships. Episode four’s first act felt like it was just filling in time for the season finale, but some conflicts have still been built upon, including showcasing how the people of Gotham are reacting to the intense political climate.",1
"535","Punch Club is tedious at times, thanks to an unfortunate level-down systems that artificially extend the road to the championship with grinding repetition, but its upgrades, stat growth, and more compensate with satisfying depth.",1
"536","If you’ve never played Arkham Asylum and Arkham City and own a current-gen console, Return to Arkham is a fine place to start. But for those who already own both on PC or last gen, there’s no real reason to pick this up beyond a rather uninspiring and technically disappointing graphical upgrade.",1
"537","All flash with little substance, Project X Zone 2 will please die-hard fans of its source material but few others.",1
"538","It’s a side-scrolling shooter with stock parts that I don’t foresee leaving a mark on the genre, but is at least worth a spin if you’ve got the patience for it and a thirst for a major challenge.",1
"539","Nova Covert Ops Mission Pack 1 stumbles by being too timid to fully flesh out some of its more interesting ideas.",1
"540","I wish this expansion had focused more on fixing Destiny’s repetition problems, because it has a few good ideas — but with all its pitfalls, this is just Destiny going through the motions.",1
"541","Despite its amazing driving simulation, Assetto Corsa just doesn’t get the racing right. Out on track alone it feels amazing; there’s no denying the remarkable realism Kunos Simulazioni has captured here. Unfortunately the team just hasn’t been able to wrap a comprehensive or competitive racing experience around it this time.",1
"542","The Flame in the Flood is a beautiful procedurally generated survival sim that gains a welcome sense of momentum from the need to stay on the move. Its unwieldy menus and tendency to crash ruins some of the fun, unfortunately, but not enough to diminish the strength of the hopeful, riverbound journey at its core.",1
"543","Throughout the early levels and into the more advanced stages, this fun, occasionally frustrating strategy game continues to offer plenty of reward for your time and effort, but lacks the character to make the spirit of the simulation as enticing as its systems.",1
"544","A brief, but mostly entertaining chapter in Rise of the Tomb Raider’s lore. While I would have happily swapped the return to the Soviet Installation for a new challenge tomb, its supernatural elements added a noticeably different feel and a welcome sense of tension to Lara’s new adventure.",1
"545","Layers of Fear lacks the surprises and subtlety needed to keep things interesting all the way through. It makes a strong first impression, but quickly exhausts its best ideas, making it hard for them to really shine as scary or meaningful moments. It’s hard to be terrified when you can see what’s coming at the end of every long dark hallway.",1
"546","Wayward Sky is a good example of how well suited VR is for point-and-click style adventures. It uses perspective and gesture-based gameplay to immerse you in a world that is, on its own, a well made and inviting one. Though I’ll most likely forget forget much of its gameplay sooner than later, Wayward Sky’s setting and ambiance will stay with me long after.",1
"547","The world can be fun to dive into, but actually playing Yo-kai Watch can shift from tedious to outright boring. For every new story idea or impressive blend of humor and pathos in its writing, Yo-kai Watch 2 fails to breathe life into the act of actually playing it, and until something’s done about all the issues with combat, no amount of delicious doughnuts can cover up its problems.",1
"548","The staples of Mirror’s Edge remain refreshing and unique in the first-person genre in 2016, but Catalyst’s attempts to keep up with the open-world Joneses don’t always jive with its design strengths of movement and momentum. On top of that, muddy-looking console versions and a lame story filled with unlikable characters doom Mirror’s Edge’s return to fall short.",1
"549","Let It Die has numerous rough edges, but it manages to entertain through the sheer force of its weird personality and its varied, if clumsy combat. The controls are often clunky and there's rarely a meaningful sense of attachment to characters or gear, but its characterizations and settings often manage to keep the pain of the poorer stuff down to a minimum, at least for a while.",1
"550","Ezio’s trilogy helped build Assassin’s Creed into the giant franchise it is today thanks to its fantastic storytelling, amazing characters, and gorgeous world building. And while all of that is still here in The Ezio Collection, the lack of meaningful improvements and any sort of substantial bonus content make it a tough compilation to recommend.",1
"551","A seemingly pointless resource management system presents some interesting aesthetics, but overall, Valley very rarely presents the challenge or consequence it really needs to be addictive.",1
"552","Rise of Iron has just enough new content to keep me coming back for a while, but it feels like the bare minimum.",1
"553","Even as a mere horror-flavored rail shooter lacking in any serious scares, Until Dawn: Rush of Blood isn’t terrible. Responsive, arcade-style shooting, the frequency of collectibles, optional side passages that add some sense of exploration to the linear rollercoaster, and an end-of-level letter grade system offer plenty of casual replayability. Coupled with its smooth, motion-based controls, and barring some of its weaker stages, Rush of Blood actually makes for a decently fun ride.",1
"554","The bottom line is if you haven’t played any three of these games, this is the best looking console version to date, and these enduring zombie-smashing games are still worth a playthrough. Outside of that, there’s nothing new in this Triple Pack to draw old Frank West fans back to experience the chaos again before he returns in Dead Rising 4 this December.",1
"555","Despite being a relatively-simple 3D platformer, Bound’s fantastic sense of movement and strange, dream-like world make it utterly unique. It’s a testament to phenomenal controls and sense of grace that I was able to set aside the camera and design flaws, and fully immerse myself in this strange, beautiful story.",1
"556","The cast of Battleborn is fantastic; I've enjoyed exploring the ins and outs of characters like the steampunk sniper Marquis and fungal healer Miko, and every time I play I'm focused on earning further access to the unique roster. However, there’s no interesting story for them to take part in, and a lack of interesting stages and multiplayer modes inspiring me to power through the slow unlocking process.",1
"557","LEGO Marvel's Avengers is fun, but unfortunately restricted by stubbornly sticking to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",1
"558","Ezio’s trilogy helped build Assassin’s Creed into the giant franchise it is today thanks to its fantastic storytelling, amazing characters, and gorgeous world building. And while all of that is still here in The Ezio Collection, the lack of meaningful improvements and any sort of substantial bonus content make it a tough compilation to recommend.",1
"559","Edge of Nowhere stands out in the current library of VR games only because it’s one of the longer and more polished games out there, but compared to the conventional third-person action-stealth games it closely emulates it’s competent but unremarkable. [Tested with Oculus Rift]",1
"560","After two episodes, The Walking Dead: Michonne successfully developed its main character at the expense of the rest of its cast. In Episode 3, the trade-off doesn’t feel quite worth it — it’s so concerned with drawing explicit connections and tying every thread together that it isn’t that satisfying as an ending. A critical reveal redeems it somewhat, but once the episode begins to over explain that, too, the impact sadly fades.",1
"561","No Man's Sky reaches for the stars but falls short by light years. It's amazingly big, but too often poorly designed.",1
"562","In a way it’s a nice change-up to the established formula to date but the drab and gloomy farm isn’t an especially memorable environment. It is, however, the trickiest series of hits this season thanks to a big push for stealth, and probably the lengthiest episode so far.",1
"563","On the whole, Hyrule Warriors Legends is an ok experience for New 3DS owners. Despite adding five awesome characters and some smart control-swapping and fast-travel options, the performance problems and shabby-looking graphics make it difficult to appreciate all the fanservice that’s packed in here. The poorly downgraded textures, hideous menus, and pop-in are all real eyesores. And stay away from 3D if you prefer a stable framerate.",1
"564","The world can be fun to dive into, but actually playing Yo-kai Watch can shift from tedious to outright boring. For every new story idea or impressive blend of humor and pathos in its writing, Yo-kai Watch 2 fails to breathe life into the act of actually playing it, and until something’s done about all the issues with combat, no amount of delicious doughnuts can cover up its problems.",1
"565","Dead Star has the basics of combat and ship balance right, to the point that even losses have their fun moments. Its primary shortcoming is that it allows too great an advantage for pre-made groups, which is especially a problem considering the wonky matchmaker.",1
"566","For a few hours at least, Final Fantasy Explorers is a charming little adventure that’s fun to play alone with your monster buddies or with real-life friends. But repetitive quests, the lack of a serious challenge until late in the story and a poor travel system eventually broke the charm spell that Explorers had cast upon me.",1
"567","True to its title, The Walking Dead: Michonne - Episode 1 is all about one character, somewhat to the detriment of the story and other characters. Michonne is so well done, though, from her impressive survival skills to the hollow look in her eyes, that she easily carries the entire episode.",1
"568","Insomniac's Song of the Deep is a beautiful Metroidvania robbed of much of its potential magic.",1
"569","Battleborn's fun heroes and leveling will keep you hooked despite a lack of content.",1
"570","A lot of effort was clearly put into Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization, because almost every aspect of its gameplay has an underlying set of properties and nuances to come to grips with. While I usually love that kind of complexity, here it rarely felt meaningful or even coherent. Paired with a story that lacks the stakes and urgency of the source material, it leaves Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization feeling pretty tepid aside from its enjoyable combat.",1
"571","The staples of Mirror’s Edge remain refreshing and unique in the first-person genre in 2016, but Catalyst’s attempts to keep up with the open-world Joneses don’t always jive with its design strengths of movement and momentum.

"572","Underground mixes people of low and high gear level, creating a poor experience for both.",1
"573","We’re mostly just stacking blocks in Tumble VR, and that’s rarely going to be exciting. Even when it challenged me with head-scratching feats of structural engineering it bored me with the mundanity of its theme. Adding onto that some of the PlayStation VR’s inherent limitations with tracking, and it was as often frustrating as rewarding.",1
"574","Reanimating this limp corpse of a survival game in high definition only brings back the disappointment I felt when I played it the first time.",1
"575","The cast of Battleborn is fantastic; I've enjoyed exploring the ins and outs of characters like the steampunk sniper Marquis and fungal healer Miko, and every time I play I'm focused on earning further access to the unique roster. However, there’s no interesting story for them to take part in, and a lack of interesting stages and multiplayer modes inspiring me to power through the slow unlocking process.",1
"576","There are some interesting ideas scattered throughout the world but they’re very hard to care about, since there’s nobody around to be influenced by your actions.",1
"577","It might not hold a candle to Dirt Rally in its car selection or look and feel, but it’s not bad for developer Kylotonn’s sophomore effort on the series. If Milestone’s stint turned you off, as it did me, now could be a good time to get reacquainted.",1
"578","It’s a forgettable entry in an outstanding series that just doesn’t measure up because of its story problems, overwhelming inventory management, and horrible predictability.",1
"579","With the Dead Island Definitive Edition, Dead Island and Dead Island Riptide have never looked so good. The use of Dying Light's graphics engine means almost every setting looks better and more realistic than it did at the start of the decade, but it unfortunately doesn’t run any better now than it did then.",1
"580","In small doses, I think it does its job of demonstrating the potential of VR racing. The racing genre is perfect for seated VR, and Driveclub VR delivers a functional example of that experience. Unfortunately, that’s really about all it delivers. Beyond that it’s just a pre-existing game with fewer features and graphics that make me feel like I have the vision of a 95-year-old man.",1
"581","There’s a pretty good game buried somewhere inside Cobalt, obscured by layers of poor balancing and technical glitches. The energetic combat and fun weapons make multiplayer a neat pick-up-and-play experience, but the bungled and buggy story mode just doesn’t cut it. Cobalt left me feeling blue.",0
"582","It’s great to have something made just for fans, though even Luffy's biggest supporters will be let down by the brief, limited campaign. At its best, this wild and crazy fighter makes for a fun distraction for folks who've been dying for more One Piece games to get localized.",1
"583","Michonne is undoubtedly a strong star, but the rest of the characters fall short as a supporting cast — they’re mostly backdrops and mirrors for Michonne to look into. It doesn’t hurt her character development, but it takes some of the emotion out of otherwise-powerful scenes that clearly affect Michonne deeply.",1
"584","It might not hold a candle to Dirt Rally in its car selection or look and feel, but it’s not bad for developer Kylotonn’s sophomore effort on the series. If Milestone’s stint turned you off, as it did me, now could be a good time to get reacquainted.",1
"585","Reminds me a lot of the PlayStation 2-era Evolution-developed WRC games; it’s an earnest attempt to capture the spirit of a niche motorsport series and, most importantly, it feels good to play thanks to a wide selection of tight-quarters race tracks, and decent handling. It might not hold a candle to Dirt Rally in its car selection or look and feel, but it’s not bad for developer Kylotonn’s sophomore effort on the series.",1
"586","Tharsis can never stop reminding you that you don't have control over its interstellar disaster, just the illusion of it. Every time I watched my ship fall apart, and every time I watched new events propagate across the ship that were completely impossible to stop, I felt like, win-or-lose, Tharsis was having all the fun.",0
"587","There’s some charm to Lucky’s Tale’s simplicity. It’s not exciting, but it’s finely polished. Old-fashioned 3D platforming is still fun, especially some of the boss battles, which require more precise jumping and dodging than any of the more slowly paced levels. It’s just not remarkable, especially as a showcase for VR.",1
"588","Metroid Prime: Federation Force has some neat ideas, but they’re soured by an impotent and boring primary weapon that sucks the enjoyment out of shooting and a bewildering lack of special ammunition that might’ve brought variety to the action. Due to a painfully imbalanced single-player experience co-op with friends is really the only viable way to play it, and even then it’s not really recommended.",1
"589","Robinson: The Journey is a beautiful world to explore, and being in the presence of dinosaurs can be awe-inspiring. However, almost everything about it that makes it a game rather than a non-interactive virtual experience is unpleasant. Slow progress and poor direction kills the momentum, extending what could be a four-hour experience into something nearly twice as long, and makes even the amazing-looking environments feel stale.",1
"590","In terms of presentation, Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: India remedies the stiff sense of joylessness that pervades Chronicles: China by injecting more color and personality wherever it seemed possible. That renewed energy only makes it more disappointing that the generally well-designed missions have given way to the artifice of cheap-feeling instant deaths.",1
"591","Adr1ft doesn't pioneer any new types of gameplay with VR, which is a shame because it desperately needs some variety in that area. However, it does benefit greatly from blocking off the rest of the world, creating a feeling of isolation that aligns with what your character is experiencing. Floating out over the Earth and looking down from this perspective is truly impressive. [VR Tested]",1
"592","With around 35 hours of gameplay packed in and a fun little retro beat 'em up to complement it all, though, it's the best way to play if you missed these zombie-smashers.",1
"593","Perhaps its biggest issue, at least on console, is its shoddy overall performance. While a mid or even lower range PC can handle ReCore just fine even at max settings, the Xbox One version rarely if ever manages to make it to 30 fps. It never interfered with my ability to play in any significant manner, but it definitely degrades the visual joy of exploring Far Eden a bit.",1
"594","Despite its amazing driving simulation, Assetto Corsa just doesn’t get the racing right. Out on track alone it feels amazing; there’s no denying the remarkable realism Kunos Simulazioni has captured here. Unfortunately the team just hasn’t been able to wrap a comprehensive or competitive racing experience around it this time.",1
"595","Disappoints on multiple levels, from a flat main character to unintuitive insta-fail stealth levels to clumsy combat and platforming. The few times it nails it with diorama-like puzzles and Helix powers only serve to make the rest of this side-scrolling spinoff look even worse by comparison.",1
"596","The Park doesn’t really bring anything new to the horror table, but honestly, that’s okay. Its 90 minutes are filled with an impressive atmosphere, interesting themes, and spooky places to poke around. While some of the attractions are a bit long in the tooth, The Park provides enough tension and scares to warrant a playthrough from any horror fan.",1
"597","Tharsis can never stop reminding you that you don't have control over its interstellar disaster, just the illusion of it. Every time I watched my ship fall apart, and every time I watched new events propagate across the ship that were completely impossible to stop, I felt like, win-or-lose, Tharsis was having all the fun.",0
"598","The Dwarves boasts a strong story that's taken from a bestselling novel, and it generally honors that lineage with a cast of likable and ably voiced characters. It's a good foundation, but unfortunately it's not strong enough to make up for the deficiencies of its gameplay, which include unfulfilling RPG elements and a stubborn camera.",1
"599","One Piece: Burning Blood understands what makes the pirate life so compelling in the source material, and is fairly successful in channelling that roguish spirit into its chaotic fights. That flashy, firm commitment to action will feel welcoming to One Piece's biggest fans, but confusing to everyone else.",1
"600","Some of its ideas conflict with each other (such as permadeath and teammate revival), its procedural generation doesn’t offer much in the way of replayability, and its intentional vagueness can be frustrating, but it’s good for at least a few monster-smashing runs before it gets old thanks to enjoyable combat mechanics, cheeky humor, and the promise of mystery.",1
"601","Controls are awkward at best, making it tough to appreciate how good the combat is, but there's a lot of fun here, especially in the eight multiplayer modes for up to 32 players.",1
"602","It’s a shame these four games and one sightseeing trip aren’t sold separately, because as a mismatched hodgepodge it’s a lot harder to recommend as a whole than the good parts would have been on their own.",1
"603","The newest Star Ocean is a serviceable JPRG marred by uneven production values and poor A.I.",1
"604","There's a lot to love in the way Clockwork Empires attempts to break up the construction sim framework with Lovecraftian creatures and almost assured destruction, but it often takes too long to get to the best parts and fills that time with dull busywork. For most of the hours spent, it's largely a standard colonization simulator that's hampered with an unwieldy user interface and weak AI.",1
"605","Space Hulk: Deathwing is that paradoxical game that’s hard to dislike, but also hard to love. The glorious moments of fervent xeno-purging are too fleeting, and often left me standing in dark corridors, surrounded by my slain foes, looking for any kind of context or sense of lasting accomplishment.",1
"606","Its world, while interesting to explore for a good while, is ultimately too big with too little happening in it to be a totally serviceable housing for the strong combat and platforming gameplay within.

"608","Much like you'd see in a seedy 1980s movie, Trials of the Blood Dragon is like a pretty good first hit of a drug. The buzz is short and mostly enjoyable, but it's so different that you might get hooked on the series.",1
"609","Its heart is in the right place, and that makes me wish I’d enjoyed it more. But it’s like the pancakes an eager eight-year-old tried to make their dad for Father’s Day: the ingredients are lacking in quality and the skill to assemble them just wasn’t present. All the little reasons The Technomancer is worth experiencing, all the little moments where the vision of a better game shines through, aren’t quite enough to justify choking down its shortcomings.",0
"610","The lack of any original modes or meaningful progression prevents Hardware: Rivals from having any chance at longevity. Aside from the awkward controls, everything works well enough, but nothing is memorable or satisfying.",1
"611","It's got a great gateway due to the story's ties to Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, the flashy neon art, the constant pop-culture references, and fantastic techno score.

"613","Though its world has some great aesthetic devices and a cool concept, ultimately all of Homefront: The Revolution’s elements feel repetitive, unpolished, or downright unnecessary. Over the length of its campaign it fails to deliver a satisfying - or even fully functional - shooter experience.",1
"614","Gemini: Heroes Reborn is short, drab, and derivative, but it nevertheless generally remains fun throughout its five-hour running time. In its best moments, it mixes familiar elements from beloved platformers and puzzlers to create an experience that, at least for brief moments, captures the essence of the show.",1
"615","You have to admire where The Tomorrow Children does innovate—particularly its look and social engineering—but it overly burdens you and bogs down progression with dragging resource collection and bureaucratic manipulation.

"618","Despite its pedigree, Mighty No. 9 doesn’t seem to have a good sense of what was fun about Mega Man, or 2D action-platformers in general. There are brief moments where its pieces come together, but even then it’s hamstrung by its visually joyless art and animation. The soul of the Blue Bomber just isn’t here, and worse yet there’s no endearing personality of its own, and as a result, Mighty No. 9 feels much more like a second-rate imposter than a spiritual successor.",1

"623","A fast-paced, energetic, deliberately absurd action shooter that’s mostly competent at everything it tries to do. Stunningly crafted, downright epic environments and tight, responsive gamepad controls steal the show. But it certainly doesn’t pull off anything innovative or revolutionary, and the whole experience is dragged down by spiky difficulty, half-baked RPG mechanics, and poorly constructed (though varied) boss battles.",1
"624","Like the chess move it’s named after, Alekhine’s Gun puts its pieces in the right places, but then it fails to follow through with any quality or grace. It’s hard to feel accomplished after pulling off a clean kill when the targets lack the competence to even defend themselves.",0
"625","Umbrella Corps is a bad competitive shooter that doesn’t even know how to take advantage of its few strengths. Its mechanics frequently contradict each other, balance is absurd, controls are clumsy, and it fails to pull anything meaningful from the Resident Evil universe other than some recognizable settings. With no great story hooks for horror fans and mechanics that can’t compare to most modern shooters, Umbrella Corps feels like a game made for no one.",0
"626","There's a hint of a good game in 7 Days to Die's mix of zombie attack preparedness and crafting and cooperative stands against zombies, and it has valuable ideas to contribute to the genre. In fact, you can almost hear them screaming to escape from beneath terrible graphics, barely useable menu controls, and shoddy console optimization.",0
"627","If the PC version of Prey hadn’t become completely unplayable from crashes and save-game corruption just as it was hitting its stride, I’d have called it a very good or perhaps even great game. Its strange alternate-history universe, sidequests, hidden threats, and detailed environmental storytelling make Talos I a joy to explore, one that’s well worth slogging through combat that doesn’t feel fresh enough to sustain it throughout a long game.",0
"628","Fast RMX may not be the perfect anti-gravity racing package, but it certainly offers high-speed racing and a lot of tracks to challenge yourself on. It’s a shame that the online multiplayer offering is so barebones, and that the time trial mode is currently AWOL, but in lieu of an official Wipeout or F-Zero this is a solid option to get your arcade racing fix on the Nintendo Switch.",1
"629","While its antiquated roots cause some minor frustration with unreliable hitboxes and unnecessary grinding, the foundational combat and exploration is still engaging and fun after 30 years. From long-time Wonder Boy fans to platformer enthusiasts who’ve never heard of it until now, you’ll likely be able to find whimsical fun and a neat bit of genre history in this charming adventure.",1
"630","Rime’s superficial beauty and interesting mysteries provided enough enjoyment to make me willing to put up with its shallow and familiar elements under the hood. While nothing about Rime is necessarily bad, you can find more interesting versions of nearly every single element of it in other, better games.",1
"631","Halo Wars 2 will scratch a real-time strategy itch and give you a dose of Halo-Universe flavor with a decent story, but it won’t go much deeper than that. A run-of-the-mill campaign, controls that hamper micromanagement, conspicuous bugs, and multiplayer that relies on luck limit its long-term appeal, but its fast and flashy action makes it fun for a while.",1

"634","With three hits and three duds from Capcom/Disney years that you might remember with varying levels of fondness, the Disney Afternoon Collection is clearly aimed at children of the 90s. I have trouble seeing its appeal to anyone else. But if vintage duck-based platformers are your thing, grab a Capri Sun and a handful of Gushers and invite your friends over to play.",1
"635","While it’s a shame that its dungeon dwelling enemies are far too easily exploited, Blaster Master Zero is ultimately an enjoyable reimagining of a largely overlooked 8-bit classic thanks to the rewarding exploration-focussed structure of its side-scrolling overworld. There are enough secret rooms and power-ups to seek out (including an additional ending), that I was compelled to scour every last inch over the course of my eight-hour completion time. It’s a good reboot; just not a Masterful one.",1
"636","Star Trek: Bridge Crew feels like a promising first draft of a fantastic Trek simulator, but it only goes boldly for a few hours. After the novelty of finally sitting on a beautiful Federation starship bridge wears off and you’ve exhausted the handful of mission types, all that’s left is the goofy physical comedy of messing around with your friends or strangers in VR.",1
"637","Poochy & Yoshi’s Woolly World remains one of the cutest games around. Even though most of the tactile charm of the Wii U original has been lost to the 3DS’s technical limitations, there’s still plenty of fun to be uncovered in this colourful and often inventive platformer. Incidentally, it also brings some of the happiest, catchiest music ever to the 3DS.",1
"638","Because of its diminished graphics and clumsy combat controls, Skyrim VR definitely isn’t the best way to actually play Skyrim. However, if you leave the difficulty on the default lowest setting and roam the world as a god who can slay enemies with the flick of the wrist, it’s a good way to experience Bethesda’s legendary RPG from a whole new perspective.",1
"639","I'm glad that, in NHL 18, EA continues to seek out new players for the NHL series with smart upgrades to the training system and the exciting and accessible NHL Threes mode. Those are positive strides, but the rest of the modes and features are starting to feel too familiar. If you're someone who's been following the NHL series for years, you aren't getting anything drastically new here to alter the balance or restore excitement. The EASHL is still enjoyable with a great group of buddies, and the other offline modes are decent, but this series is in need of some new approaches to gameplay and refreshes of older modes.",1

"642","Fighting my way through Ruiner felt like work, and if I weren’t obligated to finish it for the review I probably wouldn’t have bothered. It’s too bad it focuses on being difficult over being fun, because the combat totally works when you’re given access to the full range of weaponry and gadgets and can finally stand up to the nearly endless waves of varied enemies thrown at you. This one is definitely better the second time around. Games should be fun right from when you hit the start button – that’s kind of the whole point – but Ruiner puts you through too much of a hazing ritual to get there.",1

"644","Despite a lackluster ending to “Above the Law,” A New Frontier’s third episode kept me invested in Javi’s story, if not the plot as a whole. I’m a bit more wary heading into the latter half of the season after the jarring number of character entrances and exits in this episode, but if the strong character work continues, I’m more than willing to roll through the bumps of this mid-season episode. Telltale has found a sharp lens in Javi through which to analyze the ideas of family as bonds we’re forced into and choose to make ourselves. And he’s a lens, even in the season’s weakest moments, I still find myself wanting to help survive.",1
"645","Slithering up simple structures in Snake Pass is one of the most mechanically satisfying video game ideas I’ve ever experience, and it effectively creates a sensation that feels the way maneuvering like a snake might. The camera and checkpoint systems aren’t great, but the concept still managed to hook me for the five hours it took wrap up the campaign. And in the end, I wanted to go back and replay stages to round up all the collectibles I missed.",1
"646","The Switch version of Resident Evil: Revelations 2 capably handles this entertaining horror experience. The frame rate is steady and the motion controls are mostly worth using. Load times can drag on, but they aren’t frequent enough to be a big issue. If you appreciate the thrill of sharing intimate zombie encounters with a friend, the ability to play this local co-op story with one Joy-Con a piece makes it a handy game to have on your Switch.",1
"647","Yooka-Laylee contains all the pieces needed for a fun, enjoyable throwback to the 3D collectathons of the 64-bit era. The characters are charming and funny, your set of abilities is vast and entertaining, and four out of five of the worlds are fun playgrounds to explore. While it lacks the heart and polish of some of its incredible predecessors, it’s a good reminder that this genre, once thought to be dead, still has some life left in it.",1

"649","Matterfall succeeds in adapting Housemarque’s trademark style of fast, action-packed, arcadey action to the 2D platformer genre, but it feels like a puzzle half solved. There’s virtually no content here after you finish its exceptionally short campaign, outside of some harder difficulty modes and a global leaderboard to climb, and its level design isn’t well-suited for replay value. It’s a ton of fun while it lasts, but once it’s over it’s hard to not be left with a feeling of “Is that it?”",1
"650","NBA Live 18’s simplistic and fluid mechanics make for an approachable game of NBA, or WNBA, basketball.

It’s great to just tap your Skylander on the right thumbstick, like you would with an Amiibo, and have it be recognized by the hardware in a matter of seconds. This is our first chance to play Skylanders on the go, and this takes the the idea of being able to bring your Imaginators to your friends’ houses to adventure together to a whole new level.",1

"655","A very predictable update to a long-running series of dancing games that shines in visual design and unique choreography but is very loose with its tracking of your body movements. It’s not going to teach you to be a professional dancer, and it honestly doesn’t really teach you how to be good at Just Dance itself. That said, it’s still a whole lot of fun to play, and the songs that aren’t locked behind a paywall are varied and, largely, recognisable.",1
"656","Especially next to the first Mega Man Legacy Collection’s six games and nicer save system, The Mega Man Legacy Collection 2’s package of four included games is ultimately a step backward. While the games are mostly good, none of them top Mega Man 2 or 3 -- and for the record, I think 3 is the best. 8, 9, and 10 are worth revisiting for a dose of retro platforming challenge, but know what you’re up against going in.",1
"657","LEGO Worlds is commendable for its environmental diversity and the power of its creative tools to build anything you can dream of or manipulate every castle, hillside, and forest in sight. Unfortunately, fiddly menus, a pretty terrible combat system, and at times clunky and unfriendly construction controls weigh down on the wonder of finding and creating. Despite all this, I still find myself drawn back into it to discover what more the designers have hidden in the world-generation code, as coming across a massive ruined castle or an active volcano for the first time is always a treat - and an inspiration for what I want to build next.",1
"658","“Thicker Than Water,” other than its satisfying ending, is the season’s weakest episode yet. Little that precedes the action-packed conclusion feels like it has much, if any, weight to the ongoing story I’m invested in — namely Javi’s life and his relationships with Kate, Clem, and David. I’m absolutely on the hook for the season finale after that strong start and thrilling ending — I just wish everything before it hadn’t felt so thin.",1

But sometimes a slow burn can be a bit too slow thanks to its plodding movement speed, and that’s the case here. If you’re willing to wade through some deliberate pacing and lots of walking between repetitious shootouts with similar robot enemies, there are some intriguing bursts of action and sci-fi lore waiting for you on the hills of Tölva.",1

"672","Underneath a forgettable campaign and unimpressive AI, Tiny Metal houses the seed of a really deep and entertaining multiplayer wargame. But until a head-to-head mode is added, it’s not much more than a set of unchallenging training scenarios broken up by far too much overwrought dialogue. I had plenty of fun with it, but didn’t get the kind of edge-of-my-seat decision-making moments that turned the tide of a difficult battle I could find in similar games.",1
"673","A broad and goofy arsenal of unique weapons and gadgets and the ability to switch characters on the fly to access complementary abilities offers some solid combat and good mindless fun, but due to some unpolished writing and repetitive environments and enemy types, it doesn't fully live up to its heroic potential.",1
"674","Sure, it could’ve done so with a bit more subtlety – it's a bit heavy-handed at the very end – but at least Black does have a point to make. It’s just a shame that it wrapped that in a game that’s so shamelessly and distractingly derivative.",1
"675","Seven: The Days Long Gone feels like it’s trying to break new ground at every turn, but in the process it makes some really bad choices and is executed poorly. Its action is acrobatic but almost immediately gets stale, climbing is only fun when the levels allow it, most crafting systems are needlessly obtuse, and its fast-travel system actively tries to kill you on a regular basis. Add to that the regular bugs, and Seven’s days are numbered.",0
"676","Battlefront 2 does a lot of things right, offering a Star Wars experience that’s stunning to look at and wonderfully faithful to the source material, but it stumbles hard on the delivery. The campaign is amusing but scatterbrained, and worse, in multiplayer the randomized progression systems are downright hostile toward its players. EA has already made two big adjustments to this system in the week leading up to launch alone, and we can only hope that more significant changes are on the way. But right now, the Star Cards system’s frustrating progression is actively driving me away from the multiplayer battles.",1

"678","Ultimately, FIFA 18 on Switch is a story of what could have been. Watered-down game modes give the whole experience a feeling of it being a work-in-progress rather than the complete package offered in the PS4 and Xbox One version. If you only want a quick FIFA fix in single-player or local play, the Switch version delivers. But it’s such a diluted, Sunday League experience it’s impossible to recommend if you’re already playing on home consoles.",1
"679","When The Long Journey Home focuses on interactions with a diverse and entertaining cast of aliens across its procedurally generated star systems, it's possible to find a degree of wonder and personality that many roguelike seldom achieve. Unfortunately, such interactions take a back seat to a barrage of frustrating minigames with rewards that rarely match the risks. The experience as a whole suffers for it.",1

"687","Berserk and the Band of the Hawk is mindlessly repetitive, but its combat is still somehow addictive enough to be an enjoyable action game with a dark-fantasy story that stays true to its source, most suitable for fans of Berserk. It even left me craving to try out new characters in Endless Abyss Mode. But it desperately needs more challenge and variety to carry it through its campaign, especially considering you can’t bring a friend with you.",1
"688","Kylotonn has dredged this near-forgotten racing rebel from the very bottom of the barrel and fashioned it into a basic but fun, stunt-filled speedster, but I found myself regularly frustrated with its repetitive career mode, its stingy economy and nebulous unlockables, its superficial demolition derby events, and its uneven difficulty. A respectable franchise rescue mission but one that still needs some fine tuning and some extra grunt.",1
"689","Rain World is a maddening thing, because of quite how special it could have been. Beautiful environments, incredible animations and enticingly hazy mechanics are fantastic, but the sheer cruelty of how it’s pieced out to the player transcends challenge and becomes an unwanted trial.",1
"690","The Sims 4 on console includes all the free feature updates from the PC version, and while they are good new additions that should have been included with The Sims 4 to begin with, they don’t make up for the performance issues. Most of the problems are minor annoyances, but because save and menu bugs have been so frequent, this version of The Sims 4 is a generally unreliable experience, which is unfortunate since it is a genuinely fun game. And while it is disappointing that the console version is missing some community features from the PC version, I’m glad that at least cheats work.",1
"691","NBA Playgrounds isn’t as deep as NBA Street or as beautifully simple as NBA Jam, but the gameplay is still well paced and the controls are still tight. It mixes this gameplay with cartoonish qualities and a retro style that fits an arcade basketball game, and earning new packs of random players is always rewarding. That said, I’ve taken some bad beats from the random power-ups system, and the online options are slimmer than I’d like.",1
"692","Mr. Shifty is an okay brawler that uses a stylish warping ability as a cool way to get the drop on unsuspecting foes. While it’s fun to smack down security goons with quick melee skills, the horrible framerate of the final act will test your patience. If you do endure and manage to drop the final boss, Mr. Shifty doesn’t present enough reasons to replay it.",1
"693","Battlefront 2 does a lot of things right, offering a Star Wars experience that’s stunning to look at and wonderfully faithful to the source material, but it stumbles hard on the delivery. The campaign is amusing but scatterbrained, and worse, in multiplayer the randomized progression systems are downright hostile toward its players. EA has already made two big adjustments to this system in the week leading up to launch alone, and we can only hope that more significant changes are on the way. But right now, the Star Cards system’s frustrating progression is actively driving me away from the multiplayer battles.",1
"694","It’s worth a look for Burnout veterans, as long as you calibrate your expectations appropriately.",1
"695","When it works, Strafe is a generally entertaining retro-styled shooter that mixes procedurally generated levels into an experience strongly reminiscent of Quake. It's a great concept that usually comes together, but between the quirks of randomization, powerful enemies that run almost completely silent, lethal bugs, and hefty costs for vital armor and ammo powerups, a lot of the time it feels as challenging as rolling the dice and coming up with double sixes.",1
"696","It’s all such a disappointment. I very much wanted to like Lucky, because the Xbox could use a decent answer to Nintendo in the 3D platformer genre. Unfortunately, Super Lucky’s Tale definitely isn’t it.",1
"697","A broad and goofy arsenal of unique weapons and gadgets and the ability to switch characters on the fly to access complementary abilities offers some solid combat and good mindless fun, but due to some unpolished writing and repetitive environments and enemy types, it doesn't fully live up to its heroic potential.",1
"698","Impressive in some areas and disappointing in others, Bomberman's Switch debut is a bit too pricey to recommend.",1

"701","Urban Empire's premise of focusing on the political tumult that's usually behind city planning is a good one, and the emphasis on four families allows for some lightweight roleplay in how you guide your city to greatness. Unfortunately, the personal approach tends to stumble as each game more or less plays out like the last, and the constant juggle of votes makes for an experience that's more exasperating than exciting.",1
"702","When you’re playing as Jason, this is unquestionably the best Friday the 13th game ever made. I really appreciate the genuine love for the franchise on display here. Hunting down players and executing them in spectacularly gory scenes is an homage that warms my lifelong Friday-fan heart. But the fun of its asymmetrical multiplayer-only action is heavily skewed toward Jason, which means you’ll mostly be stuck playing as teens rummaging through drawers.",1
"703","Curse of Osiris landed in Destiny 2 with a thud. Its campaign and story are a bust, its new content is mixed and buggy at best, and it does nothing to address the community’s loud cries for fixes to the endgame. The few redeeming features are its more challenging and varied Adventures, and the Raid Lair’s puzzles and tough boss battle.",1
"704","Eventually, though, the heavy emphasis on the luck of level generation, the frustrations of enemy repetition, the poor tutorial, and the tendency to overrun you with tough enemies spoil the whole. Hard games are great, but there are limits.",1

"706","Need for Speed Payback is a big, competent, and confident arcade racer but it’s really let down by its linear cop chases, its overwrought and insidious upgrade system, its dreadful dialogue, and its superficial action sequences. It feels fine and it looks flashy, but Payback really went all-in on its direct-to-DVD revenge tale and it was a bust for me.",1

"709","On top of the joy of creating and playing as your own character, there’s a lot of goofy charm that makes Sonic Forces hard to be too disappointed with. The graphics are colorful and engaging, and the music is a pumping backdrop for extreme team-ups, super-speed cinematics, and lots of ruminations on the power of friendship. There are some really fun levels in the mix, too, and surprisingly strong boss fights make for some unexpected highlights. But Sonic Forces doesn’t build on its handful of good ideas as much as it should, and it screeches to a halt just as it seems to hit its stride.",1

"714","With a look this distinctive, Drawn to Death could have hit the ground running. But as a decent shooter it merely limps, thanks to a number of unfortunate design choices, a lack of options, and rampant bugs. Intricate levels, varied weapons and unique characters may have looked good on paper, but any positives Drawn to Death has get scribbled over and obscured by the constant barrage of un-funny abuse it insists on endlessly spewing in your face.",0

"717","Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3 is by no means a great game, though its value is raised by short and varied missions, fun action elements, and an ability to make me feel like a legit action hero. Regardless of how much it borrows from other games, I can’t deny that I had a good time blowing through missions and enemy troops. However, the poor graphics and technical issues like long loading times and crashes occasionally ruined the fun. And, minus any sort of multiplayer, there’s not a lot of reason to go back.",1
"718","Valkyria Revolution tells a decent tale of war, but the strength of that story is dulled by overlong, boring, and poorly animated cutscenes. It sacrifices the unique historical setting and art style of the Valkyria Chronicles series proper in favor of generic JRPG elements that fail to leave a strong impression, and its hack-and-slash combat offers little in the way of strategy and ruins its own flow with an poorly matched magic system.",1
"719","I am certainly not immune to the charms of 80s and 90s game design, but the NES version of Double Dragon wasn’t a great example for Double Dragon 4 to follow. It’s not just that this simplistic beat-em-up formula didn’t age well graphically or mechanically, it’s that it simply isn’t very fun or engaging to play in 2017.",0
"720","Overall, I really like the theme and setting of RAID: WWII, especially considering its irreverent tone that evokes memories of Inglorious Basterds. But even though I’m a sucker for all things WWII, the bullet-spongy enemies, lackluster unlocks and customization, and poor mission variety don’t excite me enough to want to play beyond a few rounds. And while it’s putting the cart before the horse, without a strong community of users to drop into a raid with, there’s even less reason to stick it to Nazi Germany in this particular instance. Very little in RAID: WWII is absurdly broken or flawed, but its mediocrity makes it a missed opportunity to create a highly replayable co-op game within the WWII shooter genre.",1

"723","A cool license and a clever time-twisting idea both go to waste in Reservoir Dogs: Bloody Days. With more mission variety, character development, and technical polish I could see this being an unexpectedly fun top-down shooter. As it is, its lack of ambition in scenario design makes too little use of its unique mechanic which, in itself, doesn’t always work the way you’d expect it to. Bloody Days also fails to really capture the feel of the movie on which it’s based, presenting iconic characters as cheap knock offs that spout their signature lines at odd moments like pull-string toys. While the shooting can be fun and challenging, this one’s definitely not worth losing an ear over.",1

"725","Hello Neighbor is a frustrating slog through a gauntlet of illogical puzzles that rely on persistence and thoroughness far more than cleverness, observation, or ingenuity. The stealth is hit-or-miss, alternating between feeling too punishing and borderline irrelevant from act to act. Some clever level design and a clear talent for making me feel creeped out eased the frustration, but don’t present enough of a reason for me to recommend anyone put themselves through 15-20 hours of this. I wish I’d just stayed on my own side of the fence.",0

"729","Like the gaming equivalent of binge-watching a playlist of the funniest Vine videos, WarioWare Gold provides some enjoyable short attention span shenanigans, particularly for newcomers. But in the absence any substantial new additions and a paucity of worthwhile extras, WarioWare Gold is more like a runner-up silver for long term fans of the series.",1
"730","Strong characters and environmental storytelling make The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit enjoyable overall.

The downside is that with the Switch’s controllers come some annoyances that make getting people settled onto your couch a bit more of a hassle than previous parties, and certain minigames are prone to annoying random upsets.",1
"738","Star Control: Origins does a great job of creating a new universe and stocking it with a diverse range of weird and funny aliens to fight in intense arcadey space battles. But everything you’re forced to do on a planet’s surface is boring at best and an annoying chore at worst, and that kills a lot of momentum.",1

"757","H1Z1 checks all of the boxes needed to be a competent battle royale game, but in its main mode it lacks a distinctive sense of character. Without the realistic depth and modular weaponry of PUBG or the wacky base-building antics of Fortnite, its streamlined design rushes toward straightforward, fast-paced action instead and ends up being dull as often as it is exciting. The more interesting thing about H1Z1 is its innovative Auto Royale mode, which translates battle royale mechanics to vehicular combat in a way we haven’t seen done better elsewhere.",1

That simplicity doesn’t refer to the combat or boss battles, though, which are complex and almost startlingly unforgiving.

When it gets going you can see the potential of the way it offers you more power if you consume its interesting citizens.

"767","With a breezy pace and a comically weird story, Little Dragons Café is a unique take on farming sims. While I loved cooking meals, establishing my inn, and the anxiety-free pace, its management mechanics have been watered down just a bit too much and result in stakes so low that much of it becomes meaningless.

It beats getting mauled by raptors, but after careful consideration, I’ve decided not to endorse this park.",0

When it's not bogging itself down in overwrought mechanics, this RPG really can spark a sense of nostalgia. Its writing, environments, battle system, and music all evoke the best moments of bygone days.

"776","There’s definitely fun to be had with My Hero One’s Justice. It’s super easy to pick up and play, the action is fast and beautiful to look at, and it does a great job of adapting the quirks and abilities from the anime to a 3D arena fighter. That fun eventually starts to fade away due to shallow combat and a weak story mode, but overall, it’s not a bad first endeavor.",1

We’re left with a repetitive, not very tactically exciting combat system and itemization that arbitrarily forces you to gear for item level rather than better stats.

While it’s a good change of pace for games based on SAO, it still lacks the polish needed to really stand out.",1
"794","Parts of Earthfall present a certain charm, and the co-op shooting experience could certainly be fun with the right group of friends. But it’s hard to get away from the fact that Earthfall is a lesser incarnation of a decade-old game, with fewer modes and missions, at a higher price.",1
"795","Lost On Mars is a strange choice for a Far Cry 5 expansion, and this risky change of scenery doesn’t pay off. While it does feature a hilarious fan-favorite character, I just wish the gameplay was as inventive as the dialogue and gun nomenclature. It’s too bad Ubisoft couldn’t find a way to make an alien world feel more interesting than the Montana countryside. Even with the addition of a jetpack, lasers, and alien bugs this planet feels dull as red dirt.",1
"796","Survive might not compare well to the tactical espionage action that’s defined the Metal Gear series we know and love, but its oddly hit-or-miss combo of some solid old ideas and some clumsy new ones has at least some appeal.",1

"798","The rich wasteland map of Fallout 76 is wasted on a mess of bugs, conflicting ideas, and monotony.",1
"799","In an effort to do everything, Fallout 76 fails to do any of it well enough to form an identity. Its multiplayer mindset robs its quests of all the moral decisionmaking that makes the series great, and all that’s left is a buggy mess of systemic designs that never seems to work together and regularly contradicts itself.",1
"800","Co-op zombie-splattering will never be devoid of fun, but Overkill's The Walking Dead is lacking in both the series' storytelling and technical polish.",1
"801","Extinction lands in that awkward position where, yeah, it’s usually fun - but you’re not really missing anything incredible by giving it a pass.",1
"802","Clumsy, superficial, and in many ways fundamentally broken, Crisis On the Planet of the Apes is an often infuriating VR game that plays like a bad arcade rail shooter from the early ‘90s. Far from reaching the artistic heights of the rebooted film series in whose world it takes place, it takes a silly, action-heavy approach to the material that doesn’t respect your intelligence.",0

"804","Past Cure never does anything special. Every time it tries to do something interesting, it immediately forgets about it and does something else. Don’t get me wrong: it’s not a bad thing to include a number of genres within one game. In fact, it can help keep it fresh if they serve as a breather from a strong central idea. The problem is that Past Cure has no strong central idea to take a break from or return to. Whether it’s the initially compelling yet convoluted supernatural story or the interesting gimmicks that never leave the tech demo phase, it’s a disorganized bundle of ideas that are never given a chance to develop into something out of the ordinary.",1
"805","While its bold and detailed environments depict Hell in the most nightmarish ways possible, even the fantastically obscene sights and creepy sounds become mundane and dull by the end of its series of repetitious mazes, unimaginative item hunts, and weak stealth gameplay.",0
"806","Underworld Ascendant is a buggy, repetitive, and boring mess of an RPG.",0
